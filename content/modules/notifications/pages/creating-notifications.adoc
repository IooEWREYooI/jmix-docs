= Creating Notifications

You can create notifications via administration UI or programmatically in code.

[[administration-ui]]
== Administration UI

After the add-on is added to your application, the main menu contains the *Notifications* item. The *Notifications browser* provides a list of created notifications and buttons for managing them.

The dialog provides the following fields to fill in:

* *Subject* - a subject of the notification. 
* *Type* - a type of notification. The installed add-on does not contain notification types, see the xref:notifications:configuration.adoc#notification-types[configuration] section to create types.
* *Recipients* - recipients of the notification. Start typing the username in the field, and select the appropriate users from the list. 
* *Channels* - a way to send notifications. The *Email* channel is available if the xref:email:index.adoc[Email] add-on is installed.
** *In-app channel* - a user will receive the notification in the application UI.
** *Email channel* - a user will receive an email with the notification. 
* *Content type* - select the format of the notification text: plain text or HTML format.

== Programmatic Creation

The *NotificationManager* service provides methods to send notifications to users.

In the example below, a notification is sent to the provided user every time a new order is created.
