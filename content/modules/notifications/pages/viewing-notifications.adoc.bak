= Viewing Notifications 

To show notifications sent to the in-app channel, add the `notificationsIndicator` UI component to an application screen as described in the xref:configuration.adoc#in-app-channel[Configuration] section.

When the user clicks on the indicator, the notifications list is opened:

When the user clicks *OK*, the notification window is closed and the notification is marked as read.
