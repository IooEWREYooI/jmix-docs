The *Runtime* tab is available only for active process instances and contains information about the current process state: execution tree, variable values, active user tasks, and failed jobs.

Selecting items in the executions tree will modify content of the *Variables* and *Tasks* tabs. If you select a particular execution, only objects related to this execution will be displayed.

Using the *Variables* tab, you can create, modify and remove process variables. Note, that when an execution is selected in the tree, a new variable will be put to the selected execution.

The *Failed jobs* tab displays the list of jobs that failed with an error. For example, if some service task method threw an exception, this service task will appear in the failed jobs list. In the UI, you can view the exception stacktrace and restore the failed job after the cause of the error is fixed.
