This section describes how to model and run a simple business process.

Let's consider that we want to create a process for reimbursement.

Three participants will be involved in the process:

* an employee who asks for the reimbursement;
* a manager who approves the reimbursement;
* an accountant who transfers money to the account of the employee.

The model that we are going to create:

== Modeling Process

//Let’s start modeling the process. 

Start the application and open the *BPM -> Modeler* screen.

When the modeler is first opened, the properties panel on the right displays properties of the process itself. Modify the fields:

* *Process id*: `reimbursement`
* *Name*: `Reimbursement`

image::quick-start/properties.png[align="center"]

Find the *Documentation* text area in the properties panel and write a process description there.

image::quick-start/description.png[align="center"]

=== Creating Start Form

Click on the `StartEvent` element on the canvas. The properties will be displayed on the properties panel. 

The *Form* section describes the form that will be displayed to users when they start the process. Let’s specify the *Input dialog* as a start process form.

image::quick-start/start-event.png[align="center"]

Then we need to specify the parameters that will be displayed to a user in the input dialog form.

Click the *Plus* button and in the *Input dialog parameter edit* dialog create a `requestNumber` parameter with the following properties:

* *Caption* – Request number.
* *Type* – String.
* *Editable* – true.
* *Required* – true.

image::quick-start/request-number.png[align="center"]

Create three more input dialog parameters:

* `expenseAmount` (type is `Decimal (double)`, editable and required)
* `expenseDate` (type is `Date`, editable and required)
* `document` (type is `File`, editable and required)

After that create an input dialog parameter `manager` with the `Entity` type, required and editable. Select `User` entity name. Specify `ComboBox` UI component for user selection. We will leave the JPQL query field blank — that means that the default query `select e from smpl_User e` will be used.

Select the `requestNumber` field in the *Business key* lookup field under the list of input dialog parameters. A business key is a domain-specific identifier of a process instance.

After adding all the parameters, the *Form* section should look this way:

image::quick-start/form.png[align="center"]

When a process is started, input dialog parameters will be saved in the corresponding process variables.

=== Creating Approval User Task

Let’s create the *Approval* user task. The start event should be selected on the canvas for displaying the pop-up menu. Click the *Append task* icon.

image::quick-start/append-task.png[align="center"]

Then click the *Change type* icon (a wrench) and select the *User Task* there.

image::quick-start/user-task.png[align="center"]

In the properties panel, specify a task name `Approval` and a task id `approval`.

We’ll use the *Process variable* assignee source. The drop-down list displays those fields and process variables that are of the `Entity` type, and their entity class implements the `UserDetails` interface. Select the `manager` process variable from the list.

image::quick-start/manager.png[align="center"]

For the *Approval task*, we should also specify a process form. It will be an input dialog again. The dialog will display process variables from the start form and one more new parameter.

Create a new input dialog parameter and in the *Process variable* drop-down list select the `requestNumber` variable. Make the field non-editable by unselecting the *Editable* checkbox.

image::quick-start/user-task-variables.png[align="center"]

In the same way create input dialog parameters for `expenseAmount`, `expenseDate` and `document` variables. They all must be non-editable.

Add a new dialog parameter with the `comment` process variable name and the `Multiline string` type. The field must be editable and non-required. This field will be used by the manager if the manager wants to make some notes when approving or rejecting the reimbursement request.

=== Creating Outcomes

At the *Approval* step, the manager has two options: to approve and to reject the request. An easy way to support this is to use outcomes. For each outcome, a button will be displayed on the form and the result will be stored in a special process variable.

Let’s create the first outcome for the *Approval* user task using the corresponding button of the *Outcomes* section in the properties panel. In the outcome editor specify an outcome id `approve`, a caption `Approve` and select an icon `CHECK` in the icons list.

image::quick-start/outcome-approve.png[align="center"]

Then create the second outcome: the id is `reject`, the caption is `Reject`, the icon is `BAN`.

After the *Approval* task is completed, the process must decide which path to choose using the outcome value. Let’s create an exclusive gateway.

Select the *Approval* task element and click the *Append Gateway* action of the context menu.

image::quick-start/append-gateway.png[align="center"]

Click the gateway and with the help of the context menu create `EndEvent` and `User task`. One sequence flow goes from the exclusive gateway to the `EndEvent` element and another one to the user task. Give names to the sequence flows: `approved` and `rejected`.

image::quick-start/flows.png[align="center"]

To specify a condition for the `approved` flow, click on the element and in the sequence flow properties panel select the `User task outcome` value in the *Condition source* combo box field. Select the `Approval` user task and the `approve` outcome.

image::quick-start/flow-approved.png[align="center"]

Do the same for the `rejected` sequence flow, but select the `reject` outcome value for it.

=== Creating Payment User Task

For the second user task set a task name `Payment` and a task id `payment`.

We will implement the following behavior: the task should be displayed for all accountants and any of them will be able to claim this task for himself. To achieve this we should not specify a particular assignee for the user task but should specify *Candidate groups* or *Candidate users*. 

Let’s create *Candidate group* for accountants. Go to the *BPM -> User groups* screen and create a new group called `Accountants` with the `accountants` code. Change the group type to `Users` and add several users to the group. 

image::quick-start/user-group.png[align="center"]

The `bpm-process-actor-ui` role should be assigned to these users to grant access to BPM screens and entities required for starting the process and working with user tasks. You can assign roles in the *Application -> Users* screen.

Go back to the modeler, select the `Payment` user task and click the edit button near the *Candidate groups* field in the *Assignee* section.

image::quick-start/candidate-groups.png[align="center"]

In the appeared dialog select *Groups source* value as `User groups` and add the `Accountants` group.

image::quick-start/groups.png[align="center"]

Configure an input dialog form for the `Payment` task. Add existing `requestNumber`, `expenseAmount`, `expenseDate`, `document` and `comment` fields. Make them all non-editable.

Add the `EndEvent` element that goes after the `Payment` user task.

=== Specifying Users to Start Process

The last thing we need to do is to specify who can start this process. If we want the process to be started by any user we may create and use a special user group. 

Open the *User groups* screen and create a new group called `All users`. Set its *Type* to `All users`, which means that this group will automatically include every user. In the modeler, select the `All users` group for process starter candidates.

image::quick-start/all-users.png[align="center"]

Go back to the modeler and click on the free space on the canvas to display the process properties. Similarly to the `Payment` task, we will define *Candidate groups* in the *Starter candidates* section.

image::quick-start/users-start.png[align="center"]

== Starting Process

The process model is ready to be deployed to the process engine. Click the *Deploy process* button on the toolbar.

image::quick-start/toolbar.png[align="center"]

To start the process, open the *BPM -> Start Process* screen. This screen displays process definitions available for starting by the current user.

== Testing Process

Select the `reimbursement` process and click the *Start process* button.

image::quick-start/start-process.png[align="center"]

The start form will appear. Fill in the fields, select `manager` and click the *Start process* button.

image::quick-start/start-form.png[align="center"]

The manager will see the assigned task in the *BPM -> My Tasks* screen.

image::quick-start/approval-step.png[align="center"]

Double-click the task. Some fields on this form are read-only as we configured in the modeler and there are two buttons for outcomes: *Approve* and *Reject*. 

image::quick-start/approval-form.png[align="center"]

Enter the comment and click the *Approve* button.
Log in on behalf of any user who is a member of the *Accountants* user group. Open the *BPM -> My Tasks* screen. You’ll see that the table is empty, but in the filter, there is an indicator that the user has a group task that can be claimed. Expand the *Group tasks* node.

image::quick-start/group-task.png[align="center"]

All users of the `Accountants` group will see the `Payment` task among their group tasks until any of the accountants claims it. Open the task form. The form is read-only – you cannot do anything with the task until you claim it. On the bottom of the form, there are two buttons: *Claim and resume* and *Claim and close*.

image::quick-start/payment-task.png[align="center"]

* *Claim and resume* button will remove the task from the list of group tasks of other users and will leave the task form on the screen. The form will become editable and buttons for completing the task will be displayed.
* *Claim and close* will remove the task from other user task lists, the process form will be closed. The task will appear in the Assigned tasks list for the current user. 

Click the *Claim and close* button. Select the `Payment` tasks node from the *Assigned tasks* group. Open the task form and complete the task using the default *Complete task* button. When we don’t specify task outcomes in the model, this default button is displayed.

image::quick-start/complete-task.png[align="center"]

The process is completed.
