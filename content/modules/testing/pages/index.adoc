= Testing

Automated Testing is a core part of Jmix as it allows creating long-term maintainable applications. Jmix provides various capabilities to support the application developer to create different types of automated tests.

Since Jmix is based on Spring Boot, all Spring Boot Testing capabilities also apply to Jmix. Spring has comprehensive documentation in their https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/reference/html/testing.html#testing[Testing reference documentation^] as well as in Spring Boot's https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring-boot-version}/reference/html/features.html#features.testing[Testing feature documentation^].

In this section only common usage of Spring Boot's testing capabilities are described. Additionally, Jmix specific testing capabilities are explained in more detail.
