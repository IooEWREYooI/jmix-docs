= 6. Working with Images

In this chapter, you will add the `picture` attribute to the `User` entity and learn how to upload and display images in UI.

[[file-ref-attr]]
== Adding File Reference Attribute

Jmix allows you to store uploaded files outside the database in a so-called _file storage_. In the simple case, it's just a file system directory with a special structure. To link the file located in the file storage to an entity, you create an attribute of the `FileRef` type.

Let's create such an attribute for managing the user picture.

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Double-click on the `User` entity in *Jmix* tool window and select the `joiningDate` attribute (to add the new attribute after it).

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `picture` into the *Name* field and select `FileRef` in the *Type* dropdown:

image::images/attribute-2.png[align="center", width="862"]

Accept the suggested value (1024) in the *Length* field. For `FileRef` attribute it defines the column length for storing a reference, not the file itself, so it doesn't limit the file size.

Click *OK*.

Select the `picture` attribute and click the *Add to Screens* (image:common/add-attribute-to-screens.svg[]) button in the *Attributes* toolbar.

The appeared dialog window will show all screens that display the `User` entity. Select both `User.edit` and `User.browse` screens and click *OK*.

Studio will create the `picture` column in the `usersTable` of the `User.browse` screen:

[source,xml]
----
<groupTable id="usersTable" dataContainer="usersDc" ...>
    ...
    <columns>
        ...
        <column id="picture"/>
    </columns>
----

and the `pictureField` component in the form of the `User.edit` screen:

[source,xml]
----
<form id="form" dataContainer="userDc">
    <column ...>
        ...
        <fileStorageUpload id="pictureField" property="picture"/>
    </column>
----

Click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Before running the application, Studio will generate a Liquibase changelog:

image::images/run-app-1.png[align="center"]

As you can see, the changelog contains a command for adding the `PICTURE` column to the `USER_` table. The column is of type `VARCHAR(1024)`, because the file reference is actually a string.

Click *OK*.

Studio will execute the changelog, then build and run the application.

Open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser and log in to the application with `admin` / `admin` credentials.

Click on the `Users` item in the `Application` menu. You will see the `Picture` column in the `User.browse` screen (scroll the table to the right):

image::images/run-app-2.png[align="center"]

Click *Edit* for a user. The UI control for uploading a picture is shown at the bottom of the form:

image::images/run-app-3.png[align="center"]

[[image-in-form]]
== Displaying Image in Form

In this section, you will improve the edit screen to display the uploaded picture in the form.

First, add a second column to the `form` component and move `fileStorageUpload` to it:

image::images/form-1.gif[]

Then add the `image` component below `fileStorageUpload` with the following attributes:

[source,xml]
----
<form id="form" dataContainer="userDc">
    ...
    <column>
        <fileStorageUpload id="pictureField" property="picture"/>
        <image id="image" property="picture"
               scaleMode="CONTAIN"
               rowspan="10" caption=""
               height="200" width="200"/>
    </column>
</form>
----

* `property="picture"` binds the `image` component to the `picture` attribute of the `User` entity.
* `scaleMode="CONTAIN"` makes sure the image fills the whole allocated area but keeps the proportions.
* `rowspan="10"` allows the component to fill up to 10 rows of the form instead of 1. So the image will occupy all available space on the right.
* `caption=""` removes the default caption inferred from the entity attribute.

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. Reopen the User edit screen:

image::images/form-2.png[align="center"]

If you upload a picture from a file, the file name will be shown by `fileStorageUpload` and the picture will be displayed by the `image` component:

image::images/form-3.png[align="center"]

[[image-in-table]]
== Displaying Image in Table

If you close the edit screen after uploading a picture, you will see that the table column shows only the name of the uploaded file:

image::images/table-1.png[align="center"]

Let's move the `picture` column to the first position and create a `columnGenerator` handler for it:

image::images/table-2.gif[]

Inject `UiComponents` object into the controller class:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private UiComponents uiComponents;
----

TIP: You can use *Inject* button in the top actions panel of the editor to inject dependencies into screen controllers and Spring beans.

Implement the handler method:

[source,java]
----
@Install(to = "usersTable.picture", subject = "columnGenerator") // <1>
private Component usersTablePictureColumnGenerator(User user) { // <2>
    if (user.getPicture() != null) {
        Image image = uiComponents.create(Image.class); // <3>
        image.setScaleMode(Image.ScaleMode.CONTAIN);
        image.setSource(FileStorageResource.class)
                .setFileReference(user.getPicture()); // <4>
        image.setWidth("30px");
        image.setHeight("30px");
        return image; // <5>
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
----
<1> The `@Install` annotation indicates that the method is a _delegate_: a UI component (table in this case) invokes it on some stage of its lifecycle.
<2> This specific delegate (column generator) receives an entity instance which is shown in the table row as an argument.
<3> The `Image` component instance is created using the `UiComponents` factory.
<4> The image component gets its content from the file storage by the reference stored in the `picture` attribute of the `User` entity.
<5> The column generator delegate returns the visual component to be shown in the column cells.

Press *Ctrl/Cmd+S* and switch to the running application. Reopen the User browse screen. You will see the user's picture in the first table column:

image::images/table-3.png[]

[[summary]]
== Summary

In this section, you have added the ability to upload and show a user's picture.

You have learned that:

* xref:files:uploading-files.adoc[Uploaded files] can be stored in a xref:files:file-storage.adoc[file storage] and linked with entities using attributes of the `FileRef` type.

* The xref:ui:vcl/components/file-storage-upload-field.adoc[] component allows you to upload files, save them into the file storage and link to an entity attribute.

* The xref:ui:vcl/components/image.adoc[] component can display images saved in the file storage.

* xref:ui:vcl/components/table.adoc#table-column-generation[Generated columns] can be used to display images in table cells.
