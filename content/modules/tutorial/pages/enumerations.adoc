= 4. Using Enumerations

In the previous chapters, you implemented management of Steps and Departments. Your application also has the default User management which came from the project template.

In this chapter, you will add the `onboardingStatus` attribute to the `User` entity and show it in UI. This attribute can have one of three values: `Not started`, `In progress`, `Completed`.

[[create-enum]]
== Creating Enumeration

An enumeration is a set of constants that is defined at design time and is not changed by users at runtime.

Let's create an enumeration to use in the `onboardingStatus` attribute.

If your application is running, stop it using the *Stop* button (image:common/suspend.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

In the *Jmix* tool window, click *New* (image:common/add.svg[]) -> *Enumeration*:

image::enumerations/enum-1.png[align="center",width=349]

In the *New Jmix Enumeration* window, enter `OnboardingStatus` in the *Class* field and select `Integer` in the *Id type* radio buttons:

image::enumerations/enum-2.png[align="center",width=503]

Click *OK*.

Studio will show the enumeration designer:

image::enumerations/enum-3.png[align="center"]

Add the required constants (`NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`) by clicking to the *Add Value* (image:common/add.svg[]) button in the toolbar of the *Values* table:

image::enumerations/enum-4.png[align="center"]

The *Value* here is the value of Java enum, *Id* is the corresponding value stored in the database. For example, instead of `IN_PROGRESS` value or its ordinal position (`1`), the database will contain the number `20`.

TIP: We recommend using `String` enum identifiers unless the enum constants should be sorted in a particular order. The `OnboardingStatus` enum is a good example of the need for sorting: you will want to show the constants in this exact order.

You can see the enumeration source code if you switch to the *Text* tab:

[[add-attr]]
== Adding Attribute to Entity and UI

Let's add the `onboardingStatus` attribute to the `User` entity:

Double-click on the `User` entity in *Jmix* tool window and select its last attribute (to add the new attribute to the end):

image::enumerations/attribute-1.png[align="center"]

Click *Add* (image:common/add.svg[]) in the *Attributes* toolbar. In the *New Attribute* dialog, enter `onboardingStatus` into the *Name* field, select `ENUM` in the *Attribute type* dropdown and `OnboardingStatus` in the *Type* dropdown:

image::enumerations/attribute-2.png[align="center"]

Click *OK*.

Select the `onboardingStatus` attribute and click the *Add to Screens* (image:common/add-attribute-to-screens.svg[]) button in the *Attributes* toolbar:

image::enumerations/attribute-3.png[align="center", width="493"]

The appeared dialog window will show all screens that display the `User` entity. Select both `User.edit` and `User.browse` screens:

image::enumerations/attribute-4.png[align="center", width="805"]

Click *OK*.

Studio will add the `onboardingStatus` attribute to the table component of the `User.browse` screen and to the form component of the `User.edit` screen.

[[run-app]]
== Running the Application

Click the *Debug* button (image:common/start-debugger.svg[]) in the main toolbar.

Before running the application, Studio will generate a Liquibase changelog:

image::enumerations/run-app-1.png[align="center"]

As you can see, the changelog contains a command for adding the `ONBOARDING_STATUS` column to the `USER_` table. The column is of type `INT`, which corresponds to the `Integer` type of the enumeration id.

Click *OK*.

Studio will execute the changelog, then build and run the application.

Open `++http://localhost:8080++` in your web browser and log in to the application with `admin` / `admin` credentials.

Click on the `Users` item in the `Application` menu. You will see the `Onboarding status` column in the `User.browse` screen:

image::enumerations/run-app-2.png[align="center"]

You can hide unneeded columns to free space for the new attributes. Hover over the right corner of the table header to reveal the control button (image:common/table-column-control-button.png[]), click it and unselect unused columns in the popup:

image::enumerations/run-app-3.png[align="center", width="851"]

Click *Create*. The UI control for selecting a status is shown at the bottom of the form:

image::enumerations/run-app-4.png[align="center", width="505"]

[[init-value]]
== Setting Initial Value for Attribute

For a newly created user, the `onboardingStatus` attribute should be automatically set to `Not started`. In this section, you will learn how to configure the `User.edit` screen to initialize this attribute.

Open the `UserEdit.java` class and find its `onInitEntity()` method:

image::enumerations/init-attr-1.png[align="center", width="833"]

This method is an event handler invoked by the framework when the edit screen is opened for a new entity instance. The `event` object passed to the method contains the new entity.

Add the following lines to the end of the method body:

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
public void onInitEntity(InitEntityEvent<User> event) {
    usernameField.setEditable(true);
    passwordField.setVisible(true);
    confirmPasswordField.setVisible(true);
    isNewEntity = true;

    User user = event.getEntity();
    user.setOnboardingStatus(OnboardingStatus.NOT_STARTED);
}
----

If you switch to the running application, close the editor screen and click *Create* again, you will see the `Onboarding status` initialized automatically:

[TIP]
====
To generate the handler method from scratch, click *Generate Handler* in the actions panel on top of the code editor and select `InitEntityEvent` in the *Controller handlers* section of the tree:

[[summary]]
== Summary

In this section, you have added the `Onboarding status` attribute to the `User` entity. This attribute is an enumeration with three possible values: `Not started`, `In progress`, `Completed`.

You have learned that:

* xref:data-model:enumerations.adoc[Enumerations] represent sets of constants that are defined at design time.

* In Jmix, an enumeration constant has a value and an id. The id is stored in the database instead of the constant or its ordinal value.

* A newly created entity attribute can be easily added to existing screens using the *Add to Screens* (image:common/add-attribute-to-screens.svg[]) button in the *Attributes* toolbar of the entity designer.

* The xref:ui:screens/screen-events.adoc#init-entity-event[InitEntityEvent] handler can be used to initialize attributes of a new entity instance in an edit screen. The handler stub can be generated by Studio if you click *Generate Handler* in the actions panel of the code editor.
