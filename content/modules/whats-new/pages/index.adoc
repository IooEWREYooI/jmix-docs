= Что нового

This section covers new features of Jmix framework and Studio {page-component-display-version}, as well as some breaking changes to be aware of when upgrading from a previous version of the framework.

[[upgrade]]
== How To Upgrade

IMPORTANT: To create new projects with Jmix {page-component-display-version} or to upgrade an existing project, you need Studio {page-component-display-version} or later, so xref:studio:update.adoc[update] your Jmix Studio plugin first.

See xref:studio:project.adoc#upgrading-project[Upgrading Project] section for how to upgrade your project using Studio. The automatic migration procedure makes the following changes in your project:

* Updates the version of Jmix BOM which in turn defines versions of all dependencies.
* Updates the version of Jmix Gradle plugin.
* Updates the version of Gradle wrapper to 7.2 in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`.

[[new-features]]
== New Features

[[java17]]
=== Support for Java 17

To use Java 17 in an application project, follow the steps below.

* Download JDK 17 and set `JAVA_HOME` as described in xref:ROOT:setup.adoc#jdk[Setup].

* In an existing project, open *File -> Project Structure* and select your JDK 17 in the *Project SDK* field. If there is no JDK 17 in the drop-down list, click *Edit* next to the field and add your new JDK to the list of SDKs known to the IDE.
+
Also, remove `sourceCompatibility = '1.8'` line in your `build.gradle` to be able to use the new language features.
+
Gradle wrapper in your project must be of version 7.2 or later (see `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`). When you upgrade your project from a previous Jmix version, Studio updates the wrapper automatically.

* When creating a new project, select JDK 17 in the *Project JDK* field of the new project wizard. If there is no JDK 17 in the list, click *Add JDK* at the bottom of the list.

If you are experiencing any problems when starting the application on JDK 17, open *Gradle Settings* in Gradle tool window and make sure that the *Gradle VM* field contains the same JDK 17 as defined for the project.

[[kotlin]]
=== Support for Kotlin

To create a new Jmix application in Kotlin, select the *Single Module Applcation (Kotlin)* template in the new project wizard.

[[cuba]]
=== Migration from CUBA

Jmix Studio now provides an automatic procedure for converting a CUBA project into Jmix one. The converted project uses a compatibility module with a set of CUBA APIs and features that were changed or removed in Jmix.

See the xref:cuba:index.adoc[] section for description of the main differences between Jmix and CUBA and instructions on how to migrate your CUBA project to Jmix.

[[user-substitution]]
=== User Substitution

The system administrator can give a user an ability to substitute another user. The substitution means the user has the security xref:security:resource-roles.adoc[permissions] and xref:security:row-level-roles.adoc[restrictions] of the substituted user. For example, if Alice substitutes Bob, she logs in to the application as Alice, but has the Bob's roles.

To see the feature in action, do the following:

* Log in as admin and create at least one more user with "UI: minimal access" role.
* Select admin in the users table and click *Additional -> User substitution*. You will see a list of users that admin can substitute.
* Add your new user to the list of users substituted by admin.
* Now you will see that the current user name in the `userIndicator` component of the main screen has changed to a drop-down list that contains the substituted user. If you select this user, the workspace will change as if you re-login as this user. But all audit features will still register "admin" - the logged in user.

API changes:

* Added `CurrentUserSubstitution` bean that can be used to obtain a currently substituted user, an authenticated user, or the effective user (which is substituted user in case of substitution, authenticated one otherwise).
+
For example:
+
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private CurrentUserSubstitution currentUserSubstitution;

private String getSubstitutedUserName() {
    User substitutedUser = (User) currentUserSubstitution.getSubstitutedUser();
    return substitutedUser == null ? "" : substitutedUser.getUsername();
}
----

* The `CurrentAuthentication.getUser()` method always returns the authenticated user.

* The `CurrentAuthentication.getAuthentication().getAuthorities()` returns authorities of the effective user. That is, in case of substitution, these authorities differ from the authorities of the authenticated user.

[[spring-configuration-metadata]]
=== Spring Configuration Metadata

Jmix modules now provide https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/configuration-metadata.html[Spring Configuration Metadata^] that allows IDE to autocomplete property names when you edit the `application.properties` file.

If you have IntelliJ Ultimate, make sure Spring and Spring Boot plugins are enabled, and configure the Spring facet for your project (you will get a notification about it when opening your project). After that, the IDE will show available properties with descriptions and provide autocompletion as soon as you start writing a property name or pressing *Ctrl+Space*.

[[specific-permissions-registry]]
=== Specific Permissions Registry

Now when you add a xref:security:resource-roles.adoc#specific-policy[specific policy] to a role using the role edit screen, you can select a policy from the list. Also, the `/permissions` xref:rest:user-session-api.adoc#permissions[REST endpoint] returns information about all specific policies granted to the current user.

These features use the new `SpecificPolicyInfoRegistry` bean which is designed to provide information about existing specific policies.

To register a custom policy created in your project, follow the convention described in the `SpecificPolicyInfoRegistry` Javadoc: create a class extending `SpecificOperationAccessContext` and provide the policy name to the base constructor, for example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyAccessContext extends SpecificOperationAccessContext {

    public MyAccessContext() {
        super("myapp.somePolicy");
    }
}
----

[[studio]]
=== Studio Improvements

==== Business Process Designer

Business process designer is now available inside Studio. It allows you to create BPMN 2.0 process definitions and save them in your project resources.

If your project includes the xref:bpm:index.adoc[BPM add-on], you can create a process definition by clicking *New (+) -> BPMN Process* in the *Jmix* tool window.

==== List of Add-ons

The *Add-ons* section of the *Jmix* tool window displays all Jmix add-ons included in the project.

==== Screens in the Jmix Tool Window

The *Backoffice UI -> Screens* element of the *Jmix* tool window displays all screens of your application.

==== Inject Dialog

The content of the *Generate -> Inject* dialog has been restructured and cleaned from irrelevant objects. It's now split into the following categories:

* *Project Beans* - Spring beans of the current project
* *Project Properties* - configuration property classes of the current project
* *Infrastructure* - frequently used framework beans
* *Other Beans* - all other Spring beans of the framework and add-ons
* *Other Properties* - all configuration property classes of the framework and add-ons

When opened in a screen controller, this dialog also contains elements relevant for UI as before.

==== Logger Generation

With the *Generate -> Logger* command, you can quickly add a SLF4J logger as a static class variable.

==== Support for Visual Components

UI designer now fully supports the following visual components: xref:backoffice-ui:vcl/containers/responsive-grid-layout.adoc[], xref:backoffice-ui:vcl/components/single-select-list.adoc[], xref:backoffice-ui:vcl/components/multi-select-list.adoc[], xref:charts:index.adoc[].

[[breaking-changes]]
== Breaking Changes

[[row-level-predicate]]
=== Return RowLevelPredicate from predicate policy methods

xref:security:row-level-roles.adoc#predicate-policy[Predicate policy] methods must now return `io.jmix.security.model.RowLevelPredicate` instead of `java.util.function.Predicate`. It is required for serialization of security configuration in a cluster.

If you have predicate policies defined by Java interface methods, just replace `Predicate` with `RowLevelPredicate`, for example:

[source,java]
----
@PredicateRowLevelPolicy(
        entityClass = User.class,
        actions = {RowLevelPolicyAction.READ})
default RowLevelPredicate<User> userIsActive() {
    return user -> !Boolean.TRUE.equals(user.isEnabled());
}
----

If you don't do this, the application will throw an exception on start, similar to the following:

----
java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.company.app.security.ViewOnlyActiveUsersRole$$Lambda$753/0x0000000800616040
 cannot be cast to class io.jmix.security.model.RowLevelPredicate
----

See details at https://github.com/Haulmont/jmix-security/issues/113.

[[jmix-data-repository-methods]]
=== Renamed JmixDataRepository methods

The following two methods of the experimental `JmixDataRepository` interface has been renamed:

* `findOne()` -> `findById()`
* `newOne()` -> `create()`

Fix your code accordingly if you use Spring Data repositories based on `JmixDataRepository`.

See details at https://github.com/Haulmont/jmix-core/issues/226.

[[data-grid-editor-close]]
=== DataGrid always fires EditorClose event

`DataGrid` inline editor now always fires the `EditorClose` event. To find out whether it was confirmed or cancelled use `isCancelled()` method of the event, for example:

[source,java]
----
dataGrid.addEditorCloseListener(closeEvent -> {
    if (closeEvent.isCancelled()) {
        // closed by Cancel button
    } else {
        // closed by OK button
    }
});
----

See details at https://github.com/Haulmont/jmix-ui/issues/451.

=== Changed TagField inner HTML

xref:backoffice-ui:vcl/components/tag-field.adoc[TagField] inner HTML layout has been changed: now all its content (tags, field, clear-all button) is placed into one `<div>` with the `jmix-tagfield-layout` class. Therefore some CSS selectors for `TagField` content may not work. If you have defined custom styles for a TagField, rewrite them considering `div` with the `jmix-tagfield-layout` class.

See details at https://github.com/Haulmont/jmix-ui/issues/674.

[[change-password-dialog]]
=== Renamed ChangePasswordDialog message keys

Due to refactoring, `ChangePasswordDialog` localized message keys have been renamed, which can affect a custom localization:

[source,properties]
----
io.jmix.securityui.screen.changepassword/ChangePasswordDialog.currentPassword
io.jmix.securityui.screen.changepassword/ChangePasswordDialog.password
io.jmix.securityui.screen.changepassword/ChangePasswordDialog.passwordRequired
io.jmix.securityui.screen.changepassword/ChangePasswordDialog.confirmPassword
io.jmix.securityui.screen.changepassword/ChangePasswordDialog.captionWithUserName
io.jmix.securityui.screen.changepassword/ChangePasswordDialog.wrongCurrentPassword
io.jmix.securityui.screen.changepassword/ChangePasswordDialog.currentPasswordWarning
io.jmix.securityui.screen.changepassword/ChangePasswordDialog.passwordsDoNotMatch
io.jmix.securityui.screen.changepassword/ChangePasswordDialog.passwordChanged
----

See details at https://github.com/Haulmont/jmix-security/issues/98.
