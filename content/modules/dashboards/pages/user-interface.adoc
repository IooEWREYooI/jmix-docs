Dashboards add-on provides administration screens for configuring dashboards. 

After the add-on is added to your application, the main menu contains the *Dashboard* item. The *Dashboard browser* provides the list of created dashboards and buttons for managing them.

The *Dashboard editor* screen appears after clicking the *Create* button in the *Dashboards* screen and allows editing dashboards and widgets. The editor contains several panels described below.

image::dashboards-editor.png[align="center"]

[[info-panel]]
=== Info Panel

The *Info* panel contains the required fields:

* *Title* - a name of the dashboard.
* *Code* - a unique identifier that is used in JSON files or for searching in the database. Also, it is needed to xref:dashboards:using-dashboard-in-screen.adoc[add a dashboard] into a screen.

The following fields can be set:

* *Refresh period* - a time period in seconds to refresh a dashboard UI.
* *Assistant bean name* - a reference to a Spring bean class that should be used for xref:dashboards:adding-business-logic.adoc[adding business logic] to the dashboard.
* *Group* - a dashboard group. Configuring groups is available from the *Dashboard browser* screen.
* *Available for all users* - a flag that defines the user access to the dashboard. If set to `false`, only the user who created the dashboard can view and edit it. Otherwise, all users can view and edit the dashboard.

[[dashboard-parameters]]
=== Dashboard Parameters

You can set dashboard parameters that can be passed as input parameters for any widget in the dashboard.

Let's look at the example with the dashboard parameter that sets the size of the text in the widget. 

image::dashboards-parameters.png[align="center"]

This parameter will be passed to all widgets in the dashboard, so you can inject it to widgets using the `@WindowParam` and `@WidgetParam` annotations.

.RandomJokeCustom.java
[source,java,indent=0]

include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/RandomJokeCustom.java[tags=dash-param]
----

Also, dashboard parameters can be passed to a dashboard by using the  xref:dashboards:using-dashboard-in-screen.adoc#dashboard-parameter[dashboard:parameter] tag.

[[components-panel]]
=== Components Panel

Components Panel has three collapsible tabs with components that can be added to the canvas. Configuring components after moving from the panel to the canvas is described in the <<configuring-layout, Configuring Layout>>, <<configuring-widget,Configuring Widget>>, and <<widget-templates, Widget Templates>>. They are described in the corresponding sections below.

[[canvas]]
=== Canvas

Canvas is a container for placing widgets and layouts. Drag an element from the palette for adding it on the canvas. When a widget or layout is on the canvas and selected, a panel with buttons is available. 

image::canvas-example.png[align="center"]

Configuring widgets and layouts on the canvas is described in the <<layout-settings, Layout Settings>> and <<widget-settings,Widget Settings>> sections.

[[structure-tree]]
=== Structure Tree

In this panel, the current dashboard structure is represented as a tree. The `Root` element is available by default and cannot be removed.

image::structure-tree.png[align="center"]

The actions from the context menu duplicate the actions available from the buttons panel on the canvas. See the <<layout-settings, Layout Settings>> and <<widget-settings,Widget Settings>> sections

[[buttons-panel]]
=== Buttons Panel

This panel, in addition to the standard buttons *OK* and *Cancel*, contains the following buttons:

* `Propagate` - publishes the `io.jmix.dashboardsui.event.DashboardUpdatedEvent` event.
* `Export JSON` - exports a dashboard to a JSON file.
* `Import JSON` - imports a dashboard from a JSON file and refreshes the editor.

Adding dashboards into a screen as a JSON file is described in the xref:dashboards:using-dashboard-in-screen.adoc[Using dashboard in screen] section.

[[configuring-layout]]
== Configuring Layout

Layouts allow you to place widgets on a dashboard in a specific way. You should add the required layout before adding widgets on the canvas.

image::layouts-panel.png[align="center"]

The following layouts are available:

* *Vertical* - widgets are placed vertically, one after another.
* *Horizontal* - widgets are placed horizontally, one after another.
* *Grid* - widgets are placed inside a grid with a specified number of rows and columns.
* *CSS* - enables full control over placement and styling of enclosed components using CSS.
* *Responsive* - widgets are placed vertically, but the number of columns changes depending on the screen width. A responsive layout is convenient for viewing dashboards on a desktop, tablet or, smartphone. After adding this layout on the canvas, the setting form will appear. The slider shows which part of the screen will be occupied by one widget when opening the dashboard on a particular device.

[[layout-settings]]
=== Layout Settings

After adding a layout on the canvas, the following actions that helps to set a layout are available:

image::layout-canvas.png[align="center"]

. *Remove* - removes a component from the canvas.
. *Weight* - changes the weight of a component in the parent container.
. *Expand* - defines a component within a container that should be expanded to use all available space in the direction of component placement. For a container with vertical placement, this attribute sets 100% height to a component; for the containers with horizontal placement - 100% width. Additionally, resizing a container will resize the expanded component.
+
image::layout-expand.png[align="center"]
+
. *Style* - enables setting a style name and modifying the component's height and width.
+
image::layout-style.png[align="center"]

Also, the actions above are available from the context menu in the <<structure-tree, structure tree>>.

[[configuring-widget]]

After moving a widget on the canvas, the *Widget editor* dialog will be opened. 

image::widget-editor.png[align="center"]

[[widget-parameter]]

image::widget-parameter.png[align="center"]

[[widget-settings]]
=== Widget Settings

After configuring widget information and parameters in the *Widget editor*, the widget appears on the canvas. The following actions that help to set a widget are available:

image::widget-canvas.png[align="center"]

image::widget-style.png[align="center"]

Also, the actions above are available from the context menu in the <<structure-tree, structure tree>>.

[[custom-widget-editor]]
=== Custom Widget Editor

You can customize the *Widget editor* dialog according to your needs.

Let's look at the example with a custom widget editor that adds the `EntityPicker` component. Then the selected entity will be used in the widget as a parameter.

First, create a blank screen xref:backoffice-ui:using-fragments.adoc[fragment] using Studio interface. In the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc#creating-new-elements[Jmix Tool Window], go to *New -> Screen* and select *Screen Fragment* template. Set the names of the descriptor and controller.

The descriptor will look like this:

.pokemon-widget-editor.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/pokemon-widget-editor.xml[tags=custom-editor]
----

Here is a controller class of the editor:

.PokemonWidgetEditor.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/PokemonWidgetEditor.java[tags=custom-editor]
----
<1> Defines a field that is used as a widget parameter.
<2> Subscribes to `ValueChangeEvent`.
<3> Set the selected value to the widget parameter.

Then, you need to define the custom editor in the widget.

.PokemonWidget.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/PokemonWidget.java[tags=with-custom-editor]
----
<1> The id of the custom widget editor is defined in the `@DashboardWidget` annotation.
<2> The widget parameter is passed from the widget editor.

The created editor will look like this in the user interface:

image::widget-custom.png[align="center"]

[[widget-templates]]
== Widget Templates

*Widget template browser* is available from the main menu. By clicking the *Create* button, the *Widget template editor* dialog is opened. The *Customize* button opens the *Widget editor* dialog.

image::template-browser.png[align="center"]

Created templates are displayed in the *Dashboard editor* screen.

image::template-dashboard.png[align="center"]
 
Also, you can save a widget from the dashboard as a template using the corresponding button on the canvas.
