[[adding-widgets]]
== Adding Widgets

By default, the add-on does not have predefined widgets. To create a widget, do the following:

1. Create a new xref:ui:using-fragments.adoc[fragment] using Studio interface. In the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc#creating-new-elements[Jmix Tool Window], go to *New -> Screen* and select *Screen Fragment* template. Set the names of the descriptor and controller.
2. In the screen controller, add the `@DashboardWidget` annotation. 
+
* Fill in the `name` parameter. It will be displayed in the xref:dashboards:user-interface.adoc#dashboard-editor[Dashboard editor]. 
* In case you are going to use a xref:dashboards:config.adoc#custom-widget-editor[custom widget editor], fill in `editFragmentId` - id of the fragment for editing a widget.

Here is an example of a simple widget that displays a company logo:

.LogoWidget.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/LogoWidget.java[tags=logo-widget]
----

.logo-widget.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/logo-widget.xml[tags=logo-widget]
----

[[updatable-widget]]
=== Updatable Widget

The `RefreshableWidget` interface allows widget to be refreshed from time to time. If the widget implements the `RefreshableWidget` interface, the `refresh()` method  will be invoked automatically on every dashboard update event.

In the example below, the widget displays a random joke. The refresh period is set in the xref:dashboards:user-interface.adoc#info-panel[Dashboard editor] while creating a dashboard.

.RandomJokeWidget.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/RandomJokeWidget.java[tags=joke-widget]
----

=== Widget Parameters

You should add the `@WindowParam` and `@WidgetParam` annotations to the class field that you want to use as a widget parameter.

The add-on provides the xref:dashboards:user-interface.adoc#widget-parameter[Parameter editor] dialog that allows creating parameters and passing them to your widget. 

Let's look at the example of how to access parameters in code. The widget shows the picture that is kept in one of the fields:

.ArtWidget.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/ArtWidget.java[tags=widget]
----
<1> A constant containing a value of the `name` field of an entity. It will be used in case a parameter is not set in a widget.
<2> Injects an instance container that holds an entity with a picture.
<3> A class field of the `Pet` type. It should have the same name as the `alias` field in the parameter editor.
<4> Injects a widget itself to set a new caption for it.
<5> In case the parameter is not set, the entity with the name specified in the constant will be used.
<6> Puts the entity in the instance container.
<7> Sets the caption of the widget.

A screen controller of a widget can look like this:

.art-widget.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/art-widget.xml[tags=widget]
----

[[custom-widget-editor]]
== Custom Widget Editor

You can customize the xref:dashboards:user-interface.adoc#widget-editor[Widget editor] dialog according to your needs.

Let's look at the example with a custom widget editor that adds the `EntityPicker` component. Then the selected entity will be used in the widget as a parameter.

First, create a blank screen xref:ui:using-fragments.adoc[fragment] using Studio interface. In the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc#creating-new-elements[Jmix Tool Window], go to *New -> Screen* and select *Screen Fragment* template. Set the names of the descriptor and controller.

The descriptor will look like this:

.pokemon-widget-editor.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/pokemon-widget-editor.xml[tags=custom-editor]
----

Here is a controller class of the editor:

.PokemonWidgetEditor.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/PokemonWidgetEditor.java[tags=custom-editor]
----
<1> Defines a field that is used as a widget parameter.
<2> Subscribes to `ValueChangeEvent`.
<3> Sets the selected value to the widget parameter.

Then, you need to define the custom editor in the widget.

.PokemonWidget.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/dashboards/ex1/screen/widgets/PokemonWidget.java[tags=with-custom-editor]
----
<1> The id of the custom widget editor is defined in the `@DashboardWidget` annotation.
<2> The widget parameter is passed from the widget editor.

The created editor will look like this in the user interface:

[[predefined-roles]]
== Predefined Roles

The add-on provides the following predefined roles:

* `dashboards-admin` - allows users to create and edit dashboards and widget templates.
* `dashboards-view` - allows users to view embedded dashboards.
* `dashboards-browse` - allows users to view a list of available dashboards.
