= Deployment

This chapter covers the deployment of Jmix applications. You will learn how to build the application and deploy it in various environments.

The typical Jmix deployment configuration consists of the following components:

* The application itself.
* A relational database.
* A reverse proxy (optional).

As any Spring Boot application, a Jmix application can be built and deployed as an executable JAR, WAR, or as a Docker image.

NOTE: All console commands in this chapter are relative to the project root.
