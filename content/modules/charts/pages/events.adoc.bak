It is possible to configure handling of different event types for each chart type. 

include::ui:page$vcl/events-hanlers-generation-tip.adoc[]

You can see a list of events that can be handled for a particular chart in the corresponding part of the xref:charts:types.adoc[Charts Types] section.

Event handling examples are available in xref:charts:examples.adoc#using-events[Using Events] section.

[[common-events]]
== Common Events

You can handle the following events that are available for all chart types:

* `LegendItemHideEvent` - is sent when hiding a legend item.
* `LegendItemShowEvent` - is sent when showing a legend item.
* `LegendLabelClickEvent` - is sent when clicking on a legend label.
* `LegendMarkerClickEvent` - is sent when clicking on a legend marker.

Above the listeners, the `SeriesBasedChart` interface contains `zoomOut`, `zoomToIndexes`, and `zoomToDates` methods for manipulating the chart axis.

The `CoordinateChart` interface similarly provides the following methods for the value axis: `zoomOutValueAxes`, `zoomOutValueAxis`, `zoomValueAxisToValues`, and `zoomValueAxisToValues`.
