= Entity Inspector

Entity Inspector provides auto-generated UI for your data model entities. It allows you to browse, create, update and remove entity instances without creating any specific UI. Also, if your entity is soft-deleted, Entity Inspector lets you browse, restore or wipe out deleted instances.

Entity Inspector respects data access constraints imposed by xref:security:index.adoc[security], so it can be helpful both for administrators and for users with limited permissions.

Open the *Data tools -> Entity inspector* view and select an entity from the *Entity type* list.

In case the entity is soft-deleted, the *Show mode* dropdown allows you to view removed entities and restore or wipe them out.

The *Export* and *Import* actions allow you to export and import entities to/from JSON. Note that one-to-many and many-to-many references are not exported together with the root entity.
