= Getting Started with Generic REST
:page-aliases: rest:quick-start.adoc

This section contains a practical guide on getting started with the generic REST API.

Letâ€™s consider that we want to retrieve information about orders in the application through the REST API.

First, add generic REST to your project according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section and start the application.

[[allow-user-access-via-rest]]
== Allow User Access via REST

When interacting with the application via the REST API, you always do this in the context of a particular user. Therefore, we need to grant the user the ability to access the application via the API.

You need to assign the predefined role `REST: minimal access` to the user that you want to use for the API interactions. The `admin` user already has all permissions because of the `system-full-access` role.

[[authenticate-against-the-api]]
== Authenticate against the API

In this example, we will use the `curl` command-line tool for interacting with the REST API.

Before loading data or sending data to the API, we need to perform a login or `Authentication request`. Use the following `cURL` command to do the request:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth/token \
   --basic --user client:secret \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   -d 'grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin'
----

The `HTTP 200` indicates a successful response which contains a JSON document with information about the result of the authentication request:

.HTTP/1.1 200
[source, json]
----
{
  "access_token": "zmSIwB4_9he68yrNsHC5N1agktA",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "refresh_token": "Tm3_v0T-eeYS6URZgoi4e_r-ub8",
  "expires_in": 31535999,
  "scope": "rest-api",
  "OAuth2.SESSION_ID": "5C46CDF266E8C8C15372887830B74F59"
}
----

The attribute `access_token` is the token you can use for further requests as part of the `Authorization` Header. It acts as a temporary credential that grants you access to the application on the user's behalf.

[[retrieve-entity-list]]
== Retrieve Entity List

With the access token you can use the generic REST API endpoints to load a list of users (replace `<access_token>` with the value obtained on the previous step). In this case, we will fetch all the users that are present in the application through the Entities API:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/rest/entities/User \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
----

The response will contain all users that are available in the application:

.HTTP/1.1 200
[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "_entityName": "User",
    "_instanceName": "  [admin]",
    "id": "60885987-1b61-4247-94c7-dff348347f93",
    "version": 1,
    "active": true,
    "username": "admin"
  }
]
----
