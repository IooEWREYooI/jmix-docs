= Data Stores

When a Jmix application is created, the main xref:data-model:data-stores.adoc[data store] already exists and can be accessed from the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix Tool Window].

By double-clicking, you can open the properties dialog of the data store. By default, HSQLDB is set as a database type.

[[database-properties]]

The following properties are available both for the main and additional data stores:

* *Database type* - type of the database server. You can select one of the available databases from the list.
* *Database URL* - a host, port, and database name.
** *Connection params* - other connection parameters. The format of the connection parameters depends on the selected DBMS. The string should include a separator between the database name and parameters. You can use the pencil button in the right part of the *Connection params* field to enter connection parameters conveniently. In this case, Studio automatically forms the connection string by adding DBMS-specific separator characters.

** *Show raw URL* - shows connection parameters as URL.
** *Integrated Security* - enables the corresponding authentication option when connecting to the Microsoft SQL Server 2012+ database.
* *Database user* and *Password* - database connection credentials.

You can use placeholders of the following type `${VAR:default_value}` where VAR is an environment variable to set database properties.

Studio resolves the placeholders and uses the resulting values for all operations with the database: test connection, recreate, update, Liquibase diff, and so on.

[[additional-data-store]]
== Additional Data Store

To create additional data store, use <<data-store-actions,an action>> from the context menu. Another way is to select the one from  *Advanced*:

See the description of the <<database-properties, database properties>> common for both the main and additional data stores above.

[[db-schema-management]]
image::data-schema.png[align="center"]

For the additional data store, specify *Data store name* and select an option in the *DB Schema Management* section:

* *Disabled* - Studio doesnâ€™t track database schema changes for this data store. This is the default mode.
* *Update Only* - provides the Update action and creates Liquibase changelogs. 
* *Create and Update* - provides the Update and Recreate actions and creates Liquibase scripts.

[[data-store-actions]]
== Data Store Actions

By right-clicking the data store item in the Jmix project tree, you can open its context menu:

image::data-actions.png[align="center",width="422"]

The number of actions shown in the menu depends on the data store type and DB schema management mode.

* *New -> Additional Data Store* - opens the dialog for creating a new data store.
* *New -> Liquibase Changelog* - generates a new xref:data-model:db-migration.adoc#changelogs[changelog] file with a correct name.
* *Manage Data Store* - opens the dialog to edit data store settings.
* *Delete Data Store* - removes the data store along with all associated configuration files and Liquibase changelogs.
* *Recreate* - recreates database belonging to the selected data store. Applicable for the main data store and additional data stores with *Create and Update* <<db-schema-management,schema management>> type.
* *Update* - updates database schema for the selected data store. Applicable for the main data store and additional data stores with *Update Only* and *Create and Update* schema management types.
* *Generate Liquibase Changelog* - generates changelog files for the selected data store by comparing data model with the database schema. Applicable for the main data store and additional data stores with *Update Only* and *Create and Update* schema management types.

include::subscription-note.adoc[]
* *Check Liquibase Changelog Includes* - checks that includes in the root changelog correspond to the add-ons used in the project. If there is a mismatch, Studio shows a notification dialog and suggests adding or removing includes.
* *Generate Model from Database* - xref:studio:reverse-engineering.adoc[generates a data model] from the selected database.
* *Jump to Source* - opens a Spring configuration class.
