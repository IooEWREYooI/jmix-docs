= Screen Designer

Screen Designer represents a number of panels and tool windows that allow you to develop a layout of the screen and set UI components properties in WYSIWYG style. The screen xref:ui:screens/descriptors.adoc[XML descriptor] editor is integrated with the Screen Designer, so you can edit the XML file directly or use the designer's panels to generate code.

include::subscription-note.adoc[]

The *Jmix UI* panel is implemented as independent IDE tool windows and appears automatically when you open the screen descriptor in the editor.

The *Jmix UI* panel consists of the *Jmix UI* hierarchy and *Jmix UI* inspector panels.

[[layout-preview-panel]]
== Layout Preview Panel

The Layout Preview panel is used to display an interactive schematic presentation of the screen layout. It shares editor space with the source code of the screen descriptor. 

image::screen-views.png[align="center",width="770"]

Use the buttons in the top right corner of the screen layout editor.

. *Editor only* - only source code is displayed in the editor.
. *Editor and Preview* - editor space is split to contain both source code and preview.
. *Preview only* - only preview is displayed in the editor.
. *Preview in Window* - source code is displayed in the editor while preview is displayed in the separate window.

The panel has several controls located in the top right corner:

image::screen-view-panel.png[align="center"]

* The *100% x 100%* drop-down list allows you to select fixed canvas size. The canvas size can be larger than the size of the preview panel, in this case additional scroll bars are added. For example, if you are developing a complex screen containing a lot of controls and want to see the preview, you can choose 1920 x 1080 canvas size and observe how a layout looks like in a big screen.
* The *Refresh* button reloads the content of the preview page.
* The *Zoom In*, *Zoom Out* and *Zoom Reset* buttons change zoom of the preview page.

Also, you can use controls to resize and align components in the layout:

Use the search box to find the component you need.

If the add-ons installed to the application have their own components, they will be shown in the palette, for example, in case of the Charts add-on:

image::screen-charts.png[align="center",width="487"]

In order to add a component to the layout, drag it from the palette to the appropriate place in the XML source code or into the <<component-hierarchy,Jmix UI hierarchy>> panel.
