At the *Entity list view fetch plan* and *Entity detail view fetch plan* steps, you can select the amount of data that will be displayed in the views. You can use one of the xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#built-in-fetch-plans[built-in] fetch plans or create your own with the help of xref:studio:fetch-plan-designer.adoc[Fetch Plan Designer] or xref:data-access:fetching.adoc#creating-fetch-plans[programmatically].

Use xref:studio:view-designer.adoc[View designer] to set up your views.
