On the *Jmix* tab, you can configure the following settings:

* In the *Additional templates artifact* field, you can specify the xref:studio:custom-project-templates.adoc[custom] templates artifact group and name separated by a colon, for example, `com.custom.templates.studio:custom-studio-templates`.
* *Send anonymous usage statistics and automated crash reports* - you can choose whether you want to send anonymous statistics or not.
+
Collecting statistics helps the developers better understand how the Studio is used and get more information to improve the product. No personal data is collected.
+
When anonymous usage statistics is enabled, Studio periodically sends the following data to the statistics server:
+
** Date and time of the statistics event.
** Studio ID - random UUID that is generated on the first start and stored on the disk.
** Studio release number.
** Operating system name.
** JDK version.
** IntelliJ IDEA version.
** IntelliJ IDEA edition, Community or Ultimate.
** List of public Jmix add-ons used in the project.
** Number of entities in the project.
** Number of screens in the project.
** Database types used in the project.
* You can check the *Use constructor injection* checkbox if you want to use constructor injection in Spring beans.

On the *Project Settings* tab, you can select the programming language that will be used to generate code in projects with Kotlin support.

If your project has mixed Java and Kotlin content, and you want to have control over the scaffolding language for every new entity, service, or screen, then set the *Always Ask* value in the drop-down list. This setting is displayed only for projects with Kotlin support enabled.

The *Enable hot deploy* checkbox is selected by default. It enables xref:studio:hot-deploy.adoc[Hot Deploy] technology.

You can manage drivers in the *Database Drivers* tab.
