If your project has mixed Java and Kotlin content, and you want to have control over scaffolding language for every new entity, service, or screen, then set the *Always Ask* value in the drop-down list. This setting is displayed only for projects with Kotlin support enabled.

You can manage drivers in the *Database Drivers* tab.
