[TIP]
====
Detailed installation instructions are placed for each add-on in the xref:ROOT:add-ons.adoc[Add-ons] section.

The *Installed* tab displays add-ons that are already added to the current project.

Installed add-ons are grouped into two categories. *Marketplace Add-Ons* are installed from Marketplace. *Custom Add-Ons* are developed by third parties and hosted in third-party repositories, including local Maven.

Also, you can use button next to *Install*, to add an add-on by coordinates.

Add-on coordinates is a Gradle dependency string, for example, `com.mycompany.addons:myaddon:0.1.5`. This string can be published on Jmix site or by the author of the add-on.
