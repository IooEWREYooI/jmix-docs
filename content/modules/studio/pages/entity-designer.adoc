= Entity Designer

Studio provides a visual designer that simplifies entity creation, so you don't need to remember all the rules and annotations.

[NOTE]
====
This feature requires a RAD or Enterprise https://www.jmix.io/subscription-plans-and-prices/[subscription^]. If you don’t have the subscription, see how to get the xref:studio:subscription.adoc[trial] version. 
====

To create an entity, use the menu in the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix Tool Window].

Then just enter a name of the entity and click *OK* in the appeared dialog.

[[entity-editor]]
For the created entity, a visual editor is available.

Studio displays three tabs in the editor. Together they form the visual Entity Designer:

* *Text* contains the source code of the entity.
* *Designer* shows the entity structure. You can add entity's attributes, set an instance name and validations using graphical interface instead of writing Java code.
* *Indexes* displays indexes and allows you to create the new ones.

== Adding Attributes

You can add attributes by clicking the *Plus* button in the *Designer* tab and configure the attribute in the appeared dialog. In the example below, the `addresses` attribute with the *Attribute type* `ASSOCIATION` is added. In this case, for one-to-many xref:data-model:entities.adoc#references[reference], you need to create an inverse attribute in the `Address` entity.

The globe button in the right part of the *Name* field lets you immediately set a user-friendly name of the attribute. It is stored in the `messages.properties` file and used by default in UI components.

Also, you can call the creation attribute dialog in the *Text* tab clicking *Add attribute* on the top panel or in the *Generate* popup.

== Creating Instance Name

Studio sets xref:data-model:entities.adoc#instance-name[an instance name] for an entity automatically when an attribute with one of the following names is added to the entity: `name`, `title`, `caption`, `label`, `summary`, `description`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `middleName`.

When you want to set another attributes for generating an instance name, use the visual constructor. You can open it by clicking the pencil button in the *Instance name* field.

Instance name can also be created in the *Text* tab. Position the cursor on the class name, click *Alt+Enter* (⌥↩) and select *Add instance name*.

== Enumerations

Studio helps to work with enumerations by providing a set of actions and the visual designer. Use the menu in the *Jmix Tool Window* to create enumeration.

When the enumeration is created, its class will be opened in the editor with two tabs.

image::entity-enum-editor.png[align="center"]

* *Text* contains the source code.
* *Designer* shows the enumeration designer where you can configure the enumeration and its values using graphical interface instead of writing Java code.

Use the *Values* table and its associated buttons to set up enumeration constants.

* *Name* column allows you to enter the enumeration constant name to be used in the code. It can be renamed later without affecting existing data in the database.
* *Value* column allows entering the id of the enumeration constant. This is the actual value stored in the database.

The globe button allows you to set localized captions for the selected enumeration constant.

Designer also provides the ability to change the Id type used by the enumeration from `String` to `Integer` and vice versa. Studio will migrate usages of the enumeration in the code. After that, you should change values of the existing enumeration constants. 

[NOTE]
====
Such migration does not migrate enumeration values already stored in the database tables, you will need to implement such migration yourself.
