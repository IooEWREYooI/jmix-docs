[[resource-role-designer]]
== Resource Role Designer

To create a new resource role, use the menu in xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix Tool Window]. 

image::role-open.png[align="center", width="248"]

Enter a role name and its code in the appeared dialog.

Resource Role Designer is integrated with the code editor that is available on the *Text* tab. You can edit the source code directly or use the Designer’s controls to generate the code.

The *Definition* tab defines basic role attributes.

[NOTE]
====
Role code is used when assigning the role to users, therefore it should not be changed after the role has been already assigned to some users.
====

On the *User Interface* tab, you can define permissions for menu items and views.

image::role-user-interface.png[align="center", width="722"]

The tree on the left displays the structure of the main menu, both project-defined views and inherited views from the framework and add-ons. The *All Views* group displays all remaining application views that are not directly available through the main menu. You can find the necessary view with the help of the search field located above the tree.

All menu items and views are denied by default. By choosing the item on the left and selecting *Allow* on the right side of the panel, you will add permission to open the corresponding menu item or view.

Use the toolbar above the tree to expand or collapse its nodes. The gear button toggles displaying views and menu items that don’t have permissions specified.

The *Allow all views* checkbox is useful when you want to grant access to all views or deny only a few.

On the *Entities* tab, you can define CRUD permissions for entities and entity attributes.

image::role-entities.png[align="center", width="722"]

The table on the left side of the panel displays entities defined in the project as well as entities inherited from the framework and add-ons. The entity list can be filtered by name with the help of the search field located above the table.

A toolbar above the entities contains the following actions:

* *Current project only* - toggles displaying inherited entities.
* *Assigned only* - toggles showing entities that don't have permissions.

All entity operations are denied by default. Using checkboxes in the table, you can allow particular operations for the selected entity.

The table on the right displays attribute permissions for the selected entity. All entity attributes are denied to view and modify by default. By selecting the *View* and *Modify* checkboxes, you can set the necessary access level for the selected attribute.

The wildcard [***] option in the attributes' table allows you to mark all attributes as available to *View* or *Modify*, including those attributes that will be added to the selected entity in the future. 

The *Allow all* checkbox in the entities' table permits all CRUD operations and allows *Modify* for all attributes, making the selected entity fully accessible for the current role.

[[specific-tab]]
On the *Specific* tab, you can define specific permissions.

image::role-specific.png[align="center", width="722"]

The framework uses specific permissions to restrict access to various mechanisms. In the tree, you can see the permissions inherited from the framework and add-ons. 

To add permission, use the plus button in the toolbar above the tree. In the *Resource* field, you should specify the name of the policy defined in your project. See how to create the specific policy in the xref:security:resource-roles.adoc#specific-policy[Specific policy] section.

All specific policies are denied by default. Select the policy in the tree and allow access in the right panel.

[[row-level-role-wizard]]
== Row-level Role Wizard

To create a new row-level role, click *New → Row-level Role* in the xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix Tool Window].

image::row-level-role-open.png[align="center", width="248"]

Enter role parameters in the appeared dialog.

Studio will create and open an annotated role interface. To add a xref:security:row-level-roles.adoc#jpql-policy[JPQL policy], click *Add Policy → JPQL Policy* in the top actions panel:

image::add-policy-button.png[align="center", width="624"]

In the *Add JPQL Policy* dialog, specify the policy parameters:

image::add-jpql-policy.png[align="center", width="636"]

Click *OK*. A method defining the policy will be added to the role interface.

Similarly, to add a xref:security:row-level-roles.adoc#predicate-policy[predicate policy], click *Add Policy → Predicate Policy* in the top actions panel. In the *Add Predicate Policy* dialog, specify an entity and select the actions for which the policy should be applied:
