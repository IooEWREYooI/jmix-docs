= BPM Designer

Studio provides BPM Designer that allows you to model your business processes in the IDE. 

include::subscription-note-ent.adoc[]

xref:bpm:index.adoc[BPM add-on] provides runtime modeler for creating process models. To start modeling your processes, you need to run your application.

Modeling business process in IDE can be useful in the following cases:

* You want to run your project in production deployment with already created and deployed process. In this case, you don't need to run the application locally and create in runtime.
* You want to create all custom process forms and services while modelling a process. In case you used modeler in the run application, you would need to stop it, add the required classes and run the application again to finish modeling the process.

To create a new process in BPM Designer in Studio, use the menu in xref:studio:tool-window.adoc[Jmix Tool Window].

Set a code and a name of the process. The code will be used as a part of the XML file name.

A new file will be created in the `resources/processes` directory. Processes from this folder will be deployed at the application start and you will find them in the *BPM -> Process definitions* page.

In the BPM designer, you can see canvas with the ability to switch between the view modes and BPM Inspector having the same functionality as the panel in the runtime modeler.

Let's loot at the case when you are going to use Jmix screen as the process form for the User task. 

In the BPM Inspector, you can create a process form while modeling.

The form creation wizard will appear.

You will be redirected to the created files of the process form and.

The same behavior is implemented for services, beans, user providers, Java delegates and listeners that you need to add into your project.
