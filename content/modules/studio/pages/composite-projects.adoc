= Composite Projects

Studio allows you to develop multiple add-ons and applications as a single IDE project, even if they are located in different source code repositories.

To create a composite project, start the project wizard and select the *Composite Project* template. Studio will create a project with the following structure (provided that the project name is `demo`):

----
root-dir/
    demo-all/
        build.gradle
        settings.gradle
----

After that, you can create or add subprojects using the *New -> Subproject* actions of the Jmix tool window. We recommend placing subprojects inside the project root next to the `<project-name>-all` aggregator project.
