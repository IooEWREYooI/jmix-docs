The trial add-on is available for 28 days after the first request. You can install it and use in a test project during this period.

CAUTION: After the trial period is expired, the application using the add-on will not run.

Trial add-ons can be used only with the latest Jmix framework version. We recommend creating a new test project and installing the trial add-on into it.
