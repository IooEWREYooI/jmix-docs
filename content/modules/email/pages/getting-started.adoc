= Getting Started with Email
:page-aliases: email:quick-start.adoc

This section contains a practical guide on sending emails.

Letâ€™s consider that we want to send emails to some addresses every time a new instance of an entity is created through the entity browse screen.

First, add Email Sending to your project according to the xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] section.

== Creating Entity and Screens

//some explanation what we are going to do

1. Create `NewsItem` entity containing the following fields:

* `date` with `LocalDate` type.
* `caption` with `String` type.
* `content` with `String` type and unlimited length.

2. Create `NewsItemBrowse` and `NewsItemEdit` screens.

== Adding Confirmation Dialog

First, let's check if the editor opened to create a new entity.

Add boolean attribute `justCreated` and subscribe to `InitEntity` event.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/email/ex1/screen/newsitem/NewsItemEdit.java[tags=just-created-1;just-created-2]
----

`justCreated` is set to `true` every time editor is opened for a new entity.

Then, subscribe to `PostCommit` event and add the following code:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/email/ex1/screen/newsitem/NewsItemEdit.java[tags=inject;post-commit-event]
----

<1> This method is invoked after commit of data context.
<2> If a new entity was saved to the database, ask a user about sending an email.
<3> Invokes a method that sends an email.

== Adding Sending Email Method

Let's add the `sendbyEmail` method that is invoked in the `postCommit` handler and sends an email asynchronously. To demonstrate how to add attachments, we will add a company's logo image as an attachment.

Here is our method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/email/ex1/screen/newsitem/NewsItemEdit.java[tags=resources;emailer;send-by-email]
----

<1> Gets a file as a byte array.
<2> Creates `EmailAttachment` object.
<3> Recipients.
<4> Email subject.
<5> The `from` address will be taken from the xref:configuration.adoc#jmix.email.from-address[jmix.email.from-address] application property.
<6> Attachments.

== Setting Sending Parameters

Set up the SMTP server xref:configuration.adoc#spring-boot-mail-properties[parameters]. You can set the parameters in the `application.properties` file of your application. Add the required parameters:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
spring.mail.host = mail.company.com
jmix.email.from-address = info@company.com
----

Here is an example of connecting to the Google SMTP server:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.protocol=smtp
spring.mail.username=username
spring.mail.password=password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
----

== Working with User Interface

Launch the application, open the `NewsItem` entity browser and click *Create*. The editor screen will be opened. Fill in the fields and press *OK*. The confirmation dialog with the question about sending emails will be shown. Click *Yes*.

Go to the *Administration -> Email History* screen of your application. You will see a record with the `Queue` status. It means that the email is in the queue and not yet sent. Email information is displayed on the right.

To send all queued email periodically, configure the xref:configuration.adoc#quartz[Quartz Scheduler].

To send an email from the UI, choose it in the *Administration -> Email History* screen and click *Resend email*. You can change or add recipients before sending. After successful sending, you will see a new line in the table with `Sent` status.
