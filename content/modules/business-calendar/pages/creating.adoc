= Creating Business Calendar

You can create business calendars at design time using annotated Java interfaces or runtime using UI screens available at *Administration → Business calendars*.

== Creating Business Calendar at Runtime

Open the *Administration → Business calendars* application screen and click the *Create* button.

After that, the *Business calendar editor* is opened.

The add-on supports the following types of holidays:

* *Day of week* - allows specifying holiday for desired week's days; for example, Saturday and Sunday.

* *Annual holiday* - repeatable yearly holidays, like the `1st of January`.

* *Cron-based holiday* - allows specifying holidays in the quartz CRON format. See http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html[Cron trigger tutorial^] for more information.

It can help specify some none trivial holidays, like the _Third Friday of every month_ or the _First Monday of July_, etc.

On the *Working schedule* tab, you can specify working hours for each day of the week. There can be more than one working period per day, but they should not overlap.

You can define some holidays as working days on the *Additional business days* tab. If such a day belongs to one of the holidays, it will be considered a working day.

== Creating Business Calendar at Design Time

You can create a business calendar at design time using annotated Java interfaces, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/businesscalendar/ex1/calendars/SampleBusinessCalendar.java[tags=business-calendar]
----

<1> Annotated business calendar is an interface annotated with the `@BusinessCalendar` annotation. You should specify the following parameters for the `@BusinessCalendar` annotation:
* `name` - a human-readable description of a given calendar;
* `code` - a unique identifier of a given calendar.
<2> Specify holiday in the quartz CRON format.
<3> Specify holiday for desired week's days.
<4> Specify holiday for a specific date.
<5> Specify holiday for an annually recurring date.
<6> Specify scheduled business days.
<7> Specify additional business days.

A business calendar created at the design time is displayed in the list of all business calendars and is available only for viewing.
