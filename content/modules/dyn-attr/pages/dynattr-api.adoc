= Dynamic Attributes API

== Model

Dynamic attributes implement the Entity-Attribute-Value model.

* `Category` defines a category of objects and the corresponding set of dynamic attributes. The category must be assigned to some entity type.
+
For example, there is an entity of the `Car` type. We can define two categories for it: `Truck` and `Passenger`. The `Truck` category will contain `Load capacity` and `Body type` attributes, and the `Passenger` category – `Number of seats` and `Child seat`.
+
* `CategoryAttribute` defines a dynamic attribute related to some category. Each attribute describes a single field of a definite type. The required `code` field contains the system name of the attribute. The `name` field contains the human-readable attribute name.

* `CategoryAttributeValue` – dynamic attribute value for a particular entity instance. Dynamic attribute values are physically stored in the dedicated SYS_ATTR_VALUE table. Each table record has a reference to some entity – `ENTITY_ID` column.

An entity instance can have dynamic attributes of all categories related to the entity type. So if you create two categories of the `Car` entity mentioned above, you will be able to specify any dynamic attribute from both categories for a `Car` instance.

If you want to have an ability to classify an entity instance as belonging to a single category, for example, a car can be either truck or passenger, the entity must implement `Categorized` interface. In this case, an entity instance will have the reference to a category, and dynamic attributes from this category only.

== Loading and Saving

Loading and saving dynamic attribute values is handled by `DataManager`. Use one of these methods to indicate that dynamic attributes should be loaded for entity instances:

* `setHint(DynAttrQueryHints.LOAD_DYN_ATTR, true)` method of `LoadContext`.
* `hint(DynAttrQueryHints.LOAD_DYN_ATTR, true)` method of the fluent API.

By default, dynamic attributes are not loaded. At the same time, `DataManager` always saves dynamic attributes contained in entity instances passed to `save()`.

Dynamic attribute values are available through `getValue()` / `setValue()` methods of `EntityValues`. Pass the attribute code with the `+` prefix to these methods, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/dynattr/ex1/screen/car/CarBrowse.java[tags=get-value]
----

//TODO add links to form and table
In fact, you rarely need direct access to attribute values in the application code. Any dynamic attribute can be automatically displayed in any `Table` or `Form` component bound to a data container with the entity for which the dynamic attribute was created. You can specify xref:dyn-attr:dynattr-managing.adoc#visibility[attribute visibility] in screens and components while configuring dynamic attributes.

//TODO uncomment after fix
////
User permissions to access dynamic attributes can be set in the security role editor in the same way as for regular attributes. Dynamic attributes are displayed with the + prefix.
