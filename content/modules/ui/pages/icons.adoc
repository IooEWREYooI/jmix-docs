= Icons

Image files used in the xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#icon[icon] property for xref:ui:actions.adoc[actions] and xref:ui:vcl.adoc[visual components], for example, xref:vcl/components/button.adoc[Button], can be added to your xref:ui:themes/custom_theme.adoc[custom theme].

For example, to add an icon to the Helium custom theme, you should add the image file to the `themes/helium-extended` directory described in the xref:ui:themes/custom_theme.adoc[Creating a Custom Theme] section (it is recommended to create a subfolder):

image::icons/path-to-icons.png[align="center"]

In the following sections, we consider using the icons in visual components and adding icons from arbitrary font libraries.
