= Routing API

This section describes the key concepts of the routing API.

[[route-registration]]
== Route Registration

To register a route for a screen, add the `@Route` annotation to the screen controller, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/component/button/ButtonScreen.java[tags=route;button-screen-start;button-screen-end]
----

The annotation has three parameters:

* `path` (or `value`) is the route itself.
* `parentPrefix` is used for route squashing (see <<route-squashing,below>>).
* `root` is the boolean property that enables to specify whether a route is registered for the root screen (like xref:screens/root-screens.adoc#login-screen[Login screen] or xref:screens/root-screens.adoc#main-screen[Main screen]). The default value is `false`.

[[root-screen-for-anonymous-user]]
== Creating a Root Screen for Anonymous User

If you create a root screen with a path other than the default `login` and make it available by a link without login, you should enable it for the anonymous user. Otherwise, when users enter the URL like `/#your-root-screen`, they will be re-directed to the `/#login` link instead of opening your root screen.

. Create your screen, for example, `MyAnonymousScreen`, with a button that opens the login screen:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex2/src/main/java/ui/ex2/screen/myanonymous/MyAnonymousScreen.java[tags=my-anonymous-screen]
----

. Create `AnonymousRole` and allow access to `MyAnonymousScreen`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex2/src/main/java/ui/ex2/security/AnonymousRole.java[tags=anonymous-role]
----

. Grant `AnonymousRole` to the anonymous user in the `DatabaseUserRepository`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex2/src/main/java/ui/ex2/security/DatabaseUserRepository.java[tags=init-anonymous-user]
----

. In the `application.properties` file enable anonymous access and specify which screen should be displayed for the anonymous user:
+
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex2/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=anonymous-access]
----

. Launch the application and make sure that the screen you created opens at `/#anonymous`.

[[route-squashing]]
== Route Squashing

This feature is designed to keep the URL clean and readable when opening multiple screens with routes having the same parts.

Suppose that we have browser and editor screens for the `Customer` entity:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/entity/customer/CustomerBrowse.java[tags=route;customer-browse-start;customer-browse-end]
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Route("customers/edit")
public class CustomerEdit extends StandardEditor<Customer> {
}
----

URL squashing is used to avoid repeating the `customers` route in the URL when the editor screen is opened right after the browser. Just specify the repeated part in the `parentPrefix` parameter of the `@Route` annotation on the editor screen:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/entity/customer/CustomerEdit.java[tags=route;customer-edit-start;customer-edit-end]
----

When the editor is opened in the same tab as the browser, the resulting address will be like `#main/0/customers/edit?id=â€¦`

[[mapping-of-UI-state-to-URL]]
== UI State Mapping to URL

The `UrlRouting` interface allows you to change the current application URL according to the current screen and some parameters. It has the following methods:

* `pushState()` - changes the address and pushes new browser history entry.
* `replaceState()` - replaces the address without adding new browser history entry.
* `getState()` - returns a current state as the `NavigationState` object.

The `pushState()/replaceState()` methods accept the current screen controller and optional map of parameters.

See an example of using `UrlRouting` in the section xref:url-history-navigation/url-navigation-api-usage.adoc#mapping-state-to-url[below].

[[navigation-filter]]
== Navigation Filter

The navigation filter mechanism allows you to prevent transition to some routes.

A navigation filter is a Spring bean that implements the `NavigationFilter` interface. The `@Order` annotation can be used to configure the order of invocation of all navigation filters. The `JmixOrder.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE` and `JmixOrder.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE` constants define the range which is used by filters defined in the framework.

The `NavigationFilter` interface has the `allowed()` method, which accepts two arguments: current navigation state `fromState` and requested navigation state `toState`. The method returns the `AccessCheckResult` instance and checks whether the transition from the current navigation state to the requested navigation state is allowed.

See `JmixLoginScreenFilter` as an example. It is designed for checking whether the current session is authenticated to prevent navigation to the login screen when the user is logged in already.
