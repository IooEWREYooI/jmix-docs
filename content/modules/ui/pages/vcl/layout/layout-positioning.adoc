= Positioning of Components

== Size Types

xref:ui:vcl/components.adoc[Component] dimensions: xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#width[width] and xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#height[height] - can be of the following types:

* Content-based - `AUTO`
* Fixed (pixels) - `400px`
* Relative (percent) - `100%`

== Content-dependent Size

The component will take enough space to fit its content.

Examples:

* For xref:ui:vcl/components/label.adoc[Label], the size is defined by the text length.
* For xref:ui:vcl/containers.adoc[containers], the size is defined by the sum of all component sizes inside a container.

Components and containers with content-dependent size will adjust their dimensions during screen layout initialization or when the content size is changed.

== Fixed Size

Fixed size implies that the component dimensions will not change at runtime.

== Relative Size

Relative size indicates the percentage of available space that will be occupied by the component.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/ScreenRulesScreen.java[tags=size-relative]
----

Components with relative size will react to changes in the amount of available space and adjust their actual size on the screen.

== Container Specifics

By default, containers without the xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#expand[expand] attribute provide equal space for all nested components. Exceptions: xref:vcl/containers/box-layout.adoc#flowbox[flowBox] and xref:ui:vcl/containers/html-box-layout.adoc[htmlBox].

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]

include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/container-specifics-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

Component's and container's `width` and `height` are content-dependent by default. Some containers have different default dimensions:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Container | Width | Height

|xref:ui:vcl/containers/box-layout.adoc#vbox[VBox]
|100%
|AUTO

|xref:ui:vcl/containers/group-box-layout.adoc[GroupBox]
|100%
|AUTO

|xref:ui:vcl/containers/box-layout.adoc#flowbox[FlowBox]
|100%
|AUTO
|===

The root `layout` element is a vertical container (`VBox`), which has `100%` `width` and `height`. The `height` can be `AUTO` in dialog mode.

Tabs within a xref:ui:vcl/containers/tab-sheet.adoc[TabSheet] are `VBox` containers.

The `GroupBox` component contains a `VBox` or an `HBox`, depending on the xref:ui:vcl/containers/group-box-layout.adoc#orientation[orientation] property value.

Example of a container with content-based size:

[source,xml,indent=0]

include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/vbox-layout-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

Example of a container with relative size:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/relative-size-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/container-relative.png[align="center"]

Here, `layout`, as well as `vbox` or `hbox`, provides equal space to all nested components, and `groupBox` has `100%` `height`. In addition to that, `groupBox` has `100%` `width` by default and takes all the available space.

== Component Specifics

It is recommended to set the absolute or relative `height` for xref:ui:vcl/components/table.adoc[Table] and xref:ui:vcl/components/tree.adoc[Tree]. Otherwise, a table/tree can take unlimited size, if there are too many rows or nodes.

xref:ui:vcl/containers/scroll-box-layout.adoc[ScrollBox] must have fixed or relative (but not `AUTO`) `width` and `height`. Components inside `ScrollBox`, positioned in the scrolling direction, may not have relative dimensions.

The following examples show the correct use of horizontal and vertical `ScrollBox` containers. If scrolling is required in both directions, both `height` and `width` must be set for the components (`AUTO` or absolute).

== Expand Option

The containerâ€™s xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#expand[expand] attribute allows specifying the component that will be given maximum available space.

The component specified in `expand` will have 100% size in the direction of the component expansion (vertically - for `VBox`, horizontally - for `HBox`). When container size is changed, the component will change its size accordingly.

`expand` works relatively to component expansion, for example:

----

In the following example, the auxiliary xref:ui:vcl/components/label.adoc[Label] element (spacer) is used. Due to applied `expand`, it takes all the space left in the container.
