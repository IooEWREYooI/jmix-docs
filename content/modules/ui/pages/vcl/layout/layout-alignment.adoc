= Alignment

Use the xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#align[align] attribute to align components within a container.

For example, here the `label` is located in the center of the container:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/align-label-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

Components with specified alignment should not have 100% size in the alignment direction. The container should provide more space than required by the component. The component will be aligned within this space.

An example of alignment within available space:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/align-screen.xml[tags=container]
