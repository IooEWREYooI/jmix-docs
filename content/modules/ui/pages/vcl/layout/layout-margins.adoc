= Margins and Spacing

== Margin for Screen Borders

The xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#margin[margin] attribute enables setting margins between container borders and nested components.

If `margin` is set to `true`, the margin is applied to all sides of the container.

Margins can be also set for each individual side (Top, Right, Bottom, Left). An example of top and bottom margins:

== Spacing between Components

The xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#spacing[spacing] attribute indicates whether the space should be added between nested components in the direction of the container expansion.

[NOTE]
Spacing will work correctly in case some of the nested components become invisible, so you should not use `margin` to emulate spacing.
