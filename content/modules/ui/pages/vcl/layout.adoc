Below we explain how to properly place visual components and containers on your screens.

== Positioning of Components

=== Size Types

xref:ui:vcl/components.adoc[Component] dimensions: xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#width[width] and xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#height[height] - can be of the following types:

* Content-based - `AUTO`
* Fixed (pixels) - `400px`
* Relative (percent) - `100%`

=== Content-dependent Size

The component will take enough space to fit its content.

Examples:

* For xref:ui:vcl/components/label.adoc[Label], the size is defined by the text length.
* For xref:ui:vcl/containers.adoc[containers], the size is defined by the sum of all component sizes inside a container.

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/screen-rules-screen.xml[tags=label-auto]
----

.Java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/ScreenRulesScreen.java[tags=label-auto]
----

Components and containers with content-dependent size will adjust their dimensions during screen layout initialization or when the content size is changed.

=== Fixed Size

Fixed size implies that the component dimensions will not change at runtime.

----

=== Relative Size

Relative size indicates the percentage of available space that will be occupied by the component.

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/screen-rules-screen.xml[tags=size-relative]
----

.Java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/ScreenRulesScreen.java[tags=size-relative]
----

Components with relative size will react to changes in the amount of available space and adjust their actual size on the screen.

image::vcl/screenrules/relative-size.png[align="center"]

=== Container Specifics

By default, containers without the xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#expand[expand] attribute provide equal space for all nested components. Exceptions: xref:vcl/containers/box-layout.adoc#flowbox[flowBox] and xref:ui:vcl/containers/html-box-layout.adoc[htmlBox].

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/container-specifics-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/container-specifics.png[align="center"]

Component's and container's `width` and `height` are content-dependent by default. Some containers have different default dimensions:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Container | Width | Height

|xref:ui:vcl/containers/box-layout.adoc#vbox[VBox]
|100%
|AUTO

|xref:ui:vcl/containers/group-box-layout.adoc[GroupBox]
|100%
|AUTO

|xref:ui:vcl/containers/box-layout.adoc#flowbox[FlowBox]
|100%
|AUTO
|===

The root `layout` element is a vertical container (`VBox`), which has `100%` `width` and `height`. The `height` can be `AUTO` in dialog mode.

Tabs within a xref:ui:vcl/containers/tab-sheet.adoc[TabSheet] are `VBox` containers.

The `GroupBox` component contains a `VBox` or an `HBox`, depending on the xref:ui:vcl/containers/group-box-layout.adoc#orientation[orientation] property value.

Example of a container with content-based size:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/vbox-layout-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/container-specifics2.png[align="center"]

Example of a container with relative size:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/relative-size-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/container-relative.png[align="center"]

Here, `layout`, as well as `vbox` or `hbox`, provides equal space to all nested components, and `groupBox` has `100%` `height`. In addition to that, `groupBox` has `100%` `width` by default and takes all the available space.

=== Component Specifics

It is recommended to set the absolute or relative `height` for xref:ui:vcl/components/table.adoc[Table] and xref:ui:vcl/components/tree.adoc[Tree]. Otherwise, a table/tree can take unlimited size, if there are too many rows or nodes.

xref:ui:vcl/containers/scroll-box-layout.adoc[ScrollBox] must have fixed or relative (but not `AUTO`) `width` and `height`. Components inside `ScrollBox`, positioned in the scrolling direction, may not have relative dimensions.

The following examples show the correct use of horizontal and vertical `ScrollBox` containers. If scrolling is required in both directions, both `height` and `width` must be set for the components (`AUTO` or absolute).

=== Expand Option

The containerâ€™s xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#expand[expand] attribute allows specifying the component that will be given maximum available space.

The component specified in `expand` will have 100% size in the direction of the component expansion (vertically - for `VBox`, horizontally - for `HBox`). When container size is changed, the component will change its size accordingly.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/expand-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/expand.png[align="center"]

`expand` works relatively to component expansion, for example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/expand-screen2.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/expand2.png[align="center"]

In the following example, the auxiliary xref:ui:vcl/components/label.adoc[Label] element (spacer) is used. Due to applied `expand`, it takes all the space left in the container.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/spacer-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/spacer.png[align="center"]

== Margins and Spacing

=== Margin for Screen Borders

The xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#margin[margin] attribute enables setting margins between container borders and nested components.

If `margin` is set to `true`, the margin is applied to all sides of the container.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/margin-screen-borders.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/margin.png[align="center"]

Margins can be also set for each individual side (Top, Right, Bottom, Left). An example of top and bottom margins:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/screen-rules-screen.xml[tags=margin]
----

=== Spacing between Components

The xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#spacing[spacing] attribute indicates whether the space should be added between nested components in the direction of the container expansion.

image::vcl/screenrules/spacing-false.png[align="center"]

[NOTE]
Spacing will work correctly in case some of the nested components become invisible, so you should not use `margin` to emulate spacing.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/spacing-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/spacing-true.png[align="center"]

== Alignment

Use the xref:ui:vcl/xml.adoc#align[align] attribute to align components within a container.

For example, here the `label` is located in the center of the container:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/align-label-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

image::vcl/screenrules/align-label.png[align="center"]

Components with specified alignment should not have 100% size in the alignment direction. The container should provide more space than required by the component. The component will be aligned within this space.

An example of alignment within available space:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/screenrules/align-screen.xml[tags=container]
----

== Common Layout Mistakes

Common mistake 1. Setting relative size for a component within a container with content-based size::

Example of incorrect layout with relative size:
+
image::vcl/screenrules/wrong-case1.png[align="center"]
+
In this example, a `label` has 100% `height`, while the default `height` for `VBox` is `AUTO`, that is, content-based.
+
Example of incorrect layout with expand:
+
image::vcl/screenrules/wrong-case2.png[align="center"]
+
Expand implicitly sets relative `100% height` for the `label`, which is not correct, just like in the example above. In such cases, the screen may not look as expected. Some components may disappear or have zero sizes. If you encounter any layout problems, check that relative sizes are specified correctly first of all.

Common mistake 2. Components inside a ScrollBox have 100% dimensions::

Example of incorrect layout:
+
image::vcl/screenrules/wrong-case3.png[align="center"]
+
As a result of such a mistake, scroll bars in `ScrollBox` will not appear even if the size of nested components exceeds the scrolling area.
+
image::vcl/screenrules/wrong-mistake1.png[align="center"]

Common mistake 3. Aligning components with insufficient space::

Example of incorrect layout:
+
image::vcl/screenrules/wrong-case4.png[align="center"]
+
In this example, `HBox` has content-dependent size, therefore the label alignment has no effect.
