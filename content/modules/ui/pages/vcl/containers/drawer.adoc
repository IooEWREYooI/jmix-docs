`Drawer` is a collapsible panel that allows users to toggle the content. Typically, it is used as a container for the xref:vcl/components/side-menu.adoc[SideMenu] component.

Component's XML-name: `drawer`.

[[basics]]
== Basics

The definition of the drawer in the screen descriptor should have the following structure: xref:vcl/containers/css-layout.adoc[CssLayout] contains both `drawer` and the rest of the screen layout (for example, `workArea`), with `jmix-drawer-layout` style assigned.

The `drawer` itself should include the following elements those represent:

* The `Drawer` header is `CssLayout` with `jmix-drawer-header` style assigned.
** A header icon with `app-icon` style assigned.
** A header title with `app-title` style assigned.
* The `Drawer` content, for example, xref:vcl/components/side-menu.adoc[SideMenu], with `jmix-drawer-content` style assigned.
* The `Drawer` footer, with `jmix-drawer-footer` style assigned.
** A xref:vcl/components/button.adoc[button] is placed within a `drawer` footer and used to toggle `Drawer` collapsed state.

[[toggle]]
== Toggle

The `toggle()` method expands or collapses the `drawer` depending on its current state. For example, if the `drawer` is already collapsed, it will be expanded after calling the `toggle()` method, and vice versa.

[[is-collapsed]]
You can also check the drawer's current state using the `isCollapsed()` method.

[[expand-on-hover]]
== Expand on Hover

The `expandOnHover` attribute sets a mode when the `drawer` is expanded on hover. Note that the collapse state is not changed. The default value is `false`.

[[usage-example]]
== Usage Example

The most common way to use the `drawer` is on the appâ€™s xref:screens/root-screens.adoc#main-screen[main screen].

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/drawer/drawer-screen.xml[tags=drawer]
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/containers/drawer/DrawerScreen.java[tags=drawer]
----

<1> Toggle the drawer on the button click.
<2> Change the button icon depending on the drawer state.
