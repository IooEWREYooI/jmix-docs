`Timer` is a facet designed to run some screen controller code at specified time intervals. It works in a thread that handles user interface events.
Therefore it can update xref:vcl/components.adoc[screen components]. `Timer` stops working when a screen it was created for is closed.

[[attributes]]
== Attributes

`Timer` is defined in the `facets` element of the screen XML descriptor and has the following attributes:

[[delay]]
* `delay` - required attribute. Defines timer interval in milliseconds.

[[autostart]]
* `autostart` - optional attribute. The default value is `false`, which means that the timer will start only when its `start()` method is invoked. When it is set to `true`, the timer starts immediately after the screen opening.

[[repeating]]
* `repeating` - optional attribute. Turns on repeated executions of the timer. If the attribute is set to `true`, the timer runs in cycles at equal intervals defined in the `delay` attribute. Otherwise, the timer runs only once as many milliseconds as specified in the delay attribute after the timer start.

[[handlers]]
== Events and Handlers

include::events-handlers-generation-facet-tip.adoc[]

[[timer-action-event]]
=== TimerActionEvent

`TimerActionEvent` allows you to execute some code at the time specified in the `delay` attribute. If the `repeating` attribute is set to `true`, the code specified in this event will be executed periodically, until the timer is stopped.

Programmatic registration of the event handler: use the `addTimerActionListener()` component method.

[[timer-stop-event]]
=== TimerStopEvent

`TimerStopEvent` allows you to execute some code after the timer is stopped.
