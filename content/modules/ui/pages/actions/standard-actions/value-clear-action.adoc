= ValueClearAction

`ValueClearAction` is a value picker action designed to clear the value of xref:vcl/components/value-picker.adoc[ValuePicker].

The action is implemented by the `io.jmix.ui.action.valuepicker.ValueClearAction` class and should be defined in XML using `type="value_clear"` action’s attribute. You can configure common action parameters using XML attributes of the action element. See xref:actions/declarative-actions.adoc[Declarative Actions] for details.

== Using ActionPerformedEvent

If you want to perform some checks or interact with the user before the action is executed, subscribe to the action’s `ActionPerformedEvent` and invoke the `execute()` method of the action when needed. In the example below, we show a confirmation dialog before executing the action:
