= EntityOpenCompositionAction

`EntityOpenCompositionAction` is an entity picker action designed to open an editor screen for the one-to-one composition entity selected in the xref:vcl/components/entity-picker.adoc[entity picker]. If there is no linked entity at the moment (for example, the field is empty), a new instance is created and saved by the edit screen afterward.

The action is implemented by the `io.jmix.ui.action.entitypicker.EntityOpenCompositionAction` class and should be defined in XML using `type="entity_openComposition"` actionâ€™s attribute. The action parameters are the same as for xref:actions/standard-actions/entity-open-action.adoc[EntityOpenAction].
