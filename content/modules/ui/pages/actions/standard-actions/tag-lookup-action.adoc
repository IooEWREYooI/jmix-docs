= TagLookupAction

`TagLookupAction` is a lookup action designed to select xref:data-model:entities.adoc[entity] instances from a lookup screen and set it to the xref:vcl/components/tag-picker.adoc[tag picker].

The action is implemented by the `io.jmix.ui.action.tagpicker.TagLookupAction` class and should be defined in XML using `type="tag_lookup"` action’s attribute. You can configure common action parameters using XML attributes of the action element. See xref:actions/declarative-actions.adoc[Declarative Actions] for details. Below we describe parameters specific to the `TagLookupAction` class.

== Properties

The following parameters can be set both in XML and in Java:

* `openMode` - the lookup screen opening mode as a value of the `OpenMode` enum: `NEW_TAB`, `DIALOG`, etc. By default, `TagLookupAction` opens the screen in `THIS_TAB` mode.
* `screenId` - string id of the lookup screen to use. By default, `TagLookupAction` uses either a screen, annotated with `@PrimaryLookupScreen`, or having identifier in the format of `<entity_name>.browse`, for example, `demo_Customer.browse`.
* `screenClass` - Java class of the lookup screen controller to use. It has a higher priority than `screenId`.
* `multiSelect` - whether to enable multiselect in the lookup screen. The default value is `true`.

For example, if you want to open a specific lookup screen as a dialog, you can configure the action in XML:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/actions/action-screen.xml[tags=tag_lookup]
----

Alternatively, you can inject the action into the screen controller and configure it using setters:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=inject-tagLookupAction;on-init-start;tagLookup-action-set;on-init-end]
----

== Handlers

Now let’s consider parameters that can be configured only in Java code. To generate correctly annotated method stubs for these parameters, use xref:studio:index.adoc[Studio].

=== screenOptionsSupplier

It is a handler that returns the `ScreenOptions` object to be passed to the opened lookup screen. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=tag-lookup-screen-options-supplier]
----

The returned `ScreenOptions` object will be available in the `InitEvent` of the opened screen.

=== screenConfigurer

It is a handler that accepts the lookup screen and can initialize it before opening. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=tag-lookup-screen-configurer]
----

Note that screen configurer comes into play when the screen is already initialized but not yet shown, that is, after its `InitEvent` and `AfterInitEvent` and before `BeforeShowEvent` are sent.

=== selectValidator

It is a handler that is invoked when the user clicks *Select* in the lookup screen. It accepts the object that contains the collection of selected entities. The first item of the collection is set to the field. You can use this handler to check if the selection matches some criteria. The handler must return true to proceed and close the lookup screen. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=tag-lookup-select-validator]
----

=== transformation

It is a handler that is invoked after entities are selected and validated in the lookup screen. It accepts the collection of selected entities. The first item of the collection is set to the field. You can use this handler to transform the selection before setting the entity to the field. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=tag-lookup-transformation]
----

=== afterCloseHandler

It is a handler that is invoked after the lookup screen is closed. `AfterCloseEvent` is passed to the handler. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=tag-lookup-after-close-handler]
----

== Using ActionPerformedEvent

If you want to perform some checks or interact with the user before the action is executed, subscribe to the action’s `ActionPerformedEvent` and invoke the `execute()` method of the action when needed. The action will be invoked with all parameters that you defined for it. In the example below, we show a confirmation dialog before executing the action:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=tag-lookup-action-performed-event]
----
<1> Execute action

You can also subscribe to `ActionPerformedEvent`, and instead of invoking the action’s `execute()` method, use `ScreenBuilders` API directly to open the lookup screen. In this case, you are ignoring all specific action parameters and behavior and using only its common parameters like `caption`, `icon`, etc. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/actions/ActionScreen.java[tags=inject-screen-builders;inject-customerTagPicker;tag-lookup-action-performed-event-2]
----
