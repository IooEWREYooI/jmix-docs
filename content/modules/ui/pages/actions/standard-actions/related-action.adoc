= RelatedAction

`RelatedAction` is a xref:actions/standard-actions.adoc#list-actions[list action] designed to open a browser screen with the list of related entities. Related entities are selected considering the user permissions for entities, entity attributes and screens.

[NOTE]
====
A browser screen with the list of related entities should contain the filter component.
====

The action is implemented by the `io.jmix.ui.action.list.RelatedAction` class and should be defined in XML using `type="related"` action’s attribute. You can configure common action parameters using XML attributes of the `action` element. See xref:actions/declarative-actions.adoc[Declarative Actions] for details. Below we describe parameters specific to the `RelatedAction` class.

== Properties

The following parameters can be set both in XML and in Java:

* `openMode` - the lookup screen opening mode as a value of the `OpenMode` enum: `NEW_TAB`, `DIALOG`, etc. By default, `RelatedAction` opens the lookup screen in `THIS_TAB` mode.
* `screenId` - string id of the lookup screen to use. By default, `RelatedAction` uses either a screen, annotated with `@PrimaryLookupScreen`, or having identifier in the format of `<entity_name>.browse`, for example, `demo_Order.browse`.
* `screenClass` - Java class of the lookup screen controller to use. It has a higher priority than `screenId`.
* `property` - the property from which you want to show related entities.
* `configurationName` - the caption that will be set to filter in the opened screen.

For example, if you want to open a specific lookup screen as a dialog, you can configure the action in XML:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/entity/customer/customer-browse.xml[tags=related-action]
----

Alternatively, you can inject the action into the screen controller and configure it using setters:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/entity/customer/CustomerBrowse.java[tags=inject-relatedAction;onInit-start;relatedAction-set;onInit-end]
----

== Handlers

Now let’s consider parameters that can be configured only in Java code. To generate correctly annotated method stubs for these parameters, use xref:studio:index.adoc[Studio].

=== screenOptionsSupplier

It is a handler that returns the `ScreenOptions` object to be passed to the opened lookup screen. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/entity/customer/CustomerBrowse.java[tags=related-screen-options-supplier]
----

The returned `ScreenOptions` object will be available in the `InitEvent` of the opened screen.

=== screenConfigurer

It is a handler that accepts the lookup screen and can initialize it before opening. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/entity/customer/CustomerBrowse.java[tags=related-screen-configurer]
----

Note that screen configurer comes into play when the screen is already initialized but not yet shown, that is, after its `InitEvent` and `AfterInitEvent` and before `BeforeShowEvent` are sent.

=== afterCloseHandler

It is a handler that is invoked after the lookup screen is closed. `AfterCloseEvent` is passed to the handler. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/entity/customer/CustomerBrowse.java[tags=related-after-close-handler]
----

== Using ActionPerformedEvent
You can also subscribe to `ActionPerformedEvent`, and instead of invoking the action’s `execute()` method, use `RelatedEntitiesBuilder` API directly to open the browser screen. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/entity/customer/CustomerBrowse.java[tags=related-action-performed-event]
----
