= JMX Console

This add-on provides a web UI to monitor and manage the application components through the standard Java Management Extensions (JMX) API. It is a convenient alternative to such tools as JConsole or VisualVM.

The *JMX Console* view shows all MBeans registered in the JVM of the application. A user can view and change MBean attributes and invoke operations.
