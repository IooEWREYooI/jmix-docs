= Row-level Roles

Row-level roles allow you to restrict access to particular rows of data, in other words to entity instances.

NOTE: A user without row-level roles has access to all instances of entities permitted by xref:resource-roles.adoc[resource roles].

[[create]]
== Creating Row-level Roles

You can create row-level roles at design time using annotated Java interfaces (see xref:studio:role-designer.adoc#row-level-role-designer[role designer] in Studio) or at runtime using UI screens available at *Administration -> Row-level roles*.

A role has a user-friendly name and a code. The code is used when assigning the role to users, so don't change if some users already have this role assigned.

Example of defining a design-time role:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/security/ex1/security/restrictions/LimitedAmountOrdersRole.java[tags=role-1;role-2]
----
<1> The `@RowLevelRole` annotation indicates that the interface defines a row-level role.
<2> A user-friendly name of the role.
<3> The role's code.
<4> The interface can have one or more methods to define policy annotations (see below). Different methods are used just to group related policies. Method names can be arbitrary, they are displayed as *Policy group* when the role is shown in UI.


[[policies]]
== Row-level Policies

Row-level roles define restrictions by specifying _row-level policies_ for particular entities.

[[jpql-policy]]
=== JPQL Policy

JPQL policy specifies the `where` (and optionally `join`) clause to be used when loading the entity.

JPQL policy transforms the JPQL (and hence SQL) operator and filters out restricted instances on the database level, which is very efficient in terms of performance. But keep in mind that it affects only the root entity of a loaded object graph. If an entity can be loaded as a collection in another entity's object graph, define both JPQL and <<predicate-policy,predicate>> policies for it.

In a design-time role, the JPQL policy is defined using the `@JpqlRowLevelPolicy` annotation, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/security/ex1/security/restrictions/CreatedByMeOrdersRole.java[tags=role]
----

Consider the following rules when writing JPQL policies:

* Use `\{E\}` placeholder instead of the entity alias in `where` and `join` clauses. The framework will replace it with a real alias specified in the query.

* The `where` text is added to the `where` query clause using `and` condition. Adding the `where` word is not needed, as it will be added automatically.

* The `join` text is added to the `from` query clause. It should begin with a comma, `join` or `left join`.

You can use xref:data-access:jpql-extensions.adoc#session-and-user-attributes[session and user attributes] in query parameters. For example, the `current_user_username` parameter gets its value from the `username` attribute.

You can add application-specific attributes to your `User` entity and use them in JPQL policies. For example, imagine that you have added the `region` attribute to the `User` and `Customer` entities. Then you can restrict access to `Customer` and `Order` entities by allowing users to see only entities of their region:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/security/ex1/security/restrictions/SameRegionRowsRole.java[tags=role]
----

[[predicate-policy]]
=== Predicate Policy

Predicate policy defines a predicate that is tested when performing different actions with the entity. If the predicate returns true, the action is permitted for the entity instance.

You can define predicate policies for the following actions: `READ`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.

The `READ` predicate is tested when the entity is loaded from the database for the root entity and (unlike <<jpql-policy,JPQL policy>>) all nested collections down to the loaded object graph. If an entity can be loaded as a collection in another entity's object graph, define both JPQL and predicate policies for it.

The `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` predicates are tested before the entity instance is created, updated or deleted from the database.

In a design-time role, the predicate policy is defined using the `@PredicateRowLevelPolicy` annotation, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/security/ex1/security/restrictions/NonConfidentialRowsRole.java[tags=role]
----

This example demonstrates a row-level role that should be used in addition to resource roles of the example from the xref:resource-roles.adoc#example[previous section] to restrict access to instances of `CustomerDetail` having `confidential = true` attribute. You cannot use a JPQL policy to filter out `CustomerDetail` instances from the `Customer.details` collection because it can be loaded together with the owning `Customer` in a single database operation. Predicate policies are executed in memory for root entities and nested collections.

In a runtime role, the predicate policy is defined using a Groovy script. In the script, use the `\{E\}` placeholder as a variable containing the tested entity instance. For example, the same condition as in the design-time role above can be written as the following Groovy script:

[source,groovy]
----
!{E}.confidential
----

[[accessing-spring-beans]]
==== Accessing Spring Beans

If you need to access Spring beans in the predicate, return `io.jmix.security.model.RowLevelBiPredicate` from your method. This functional interface allows you to define lambda accepting two parameters: the examined entity instance and Spring's `ApplicationContext`. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/security/ex1/security/restrictions/SameRegionCustomersRole.java[tags=role]
----

In the Groovy script, you can also use the `applicationContext` variable to access any Spring bean, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
import io.jmix.core.security.CurrentAuthentication

def authBean = applicationContext.getBean(CurrentAuthentication)

{E}.region != null && {E}.region == authBean.user.region
----
