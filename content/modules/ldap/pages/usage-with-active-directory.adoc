= Usage with Active Directory

The add-on provides a separate Security Configuration for using it with Active Directory. Since Active Directory supports its own non-standard authentication options, such as authentication with the domain username in the form `user@domain` instead of an LDAP distinguished name, Spring Security provides a separate `AuthenticationProvider`, which is customized for a typical Active Directory setup.

If you are going to work with Active Directory, set the property:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
jmix.ldap.use-active-directory-configuration = true
----

By setting this property you instruct the application to use the `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider` which is more suitable for usage with Active Directory.

You should specify the user search filter used by `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider` for searching the user:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
jmix.ldap.user-search-filter = (&(objectClass=user)(userPrincipalName={0}))
----

In the example above users will enter their username in the form `username@domain`.

Alternatively you may configure the authentication provider in the following way:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
jmix.ldap.user-search-filter = (&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName={1}))
jmix.ldap.active-directory-domain = somedomain
----

In this case, users will have to type only their username (without domain) on the login form.
