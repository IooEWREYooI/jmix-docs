= Usage with Active Directory

The add-on provides a separate Security Configuration for using it with Active Directory. Since Active Directory supports its own non-standard authentication options, such as authentication with the domain username in the form `user@domain` instead of an LDAP distinguished name, Spring Security provides a separate `AuthenticationProvider`, which is customized for a typical Active Directory setup. 

If you are going to work with Active Directory, set the property:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
jmix.ldap.useActiveDirectoryConfiguration = true
----

By setting this property, you will use the `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider`, which is more suitable for usage with Active Directory.
