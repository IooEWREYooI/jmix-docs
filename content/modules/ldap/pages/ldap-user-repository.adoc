= LDAP User Repository

When users are primarily managed in LDAP, they can be placed in the application where you need to choose a user or find a user in `SuggestionField`. For this purpose, the addon comes with the LDAP implementation of `UserRepository`. This user repository provides access to users from LDAP, but it does not provide the `system` or `anonymous` user. Also, you may want users from the database to be searchable as well.

To achieve this, declare the `CompositeUserRepository` bean, which comprises all instances of `UserRepository` in the application, for example, `LdapUserRepository` and `DatabaseUserRepository`. Make this `UserRepository` primary in the application:
