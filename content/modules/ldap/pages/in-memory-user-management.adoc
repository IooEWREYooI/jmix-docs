= In-memory User Management

If you want to manage users fully in LDAP, set the following property:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
jmix.ldap.userDetailsSource = ldap
----

In this case, standard `LdapUserDetails` objects are created by Spring Security after each authentication and preserved in memory instead of being taken from DB as the `User` entity. User authorities are obtained by the role mapping process described in the xref:ldap:obtaining-user-authorities.adoc[Obtaining User Authorities] section.

The case when maintaining users in the application is described in the xref:ldap:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started] section.
