A composite component is a component consisting of other components. Like xref:using-fragments.adoc[screen fragments], composite components allow you to reuse some presentation layout and logic. We recommend using composite components in the following cases:

* The component functionality can be implemented as a combination of existing xref:vcl.adoc[visual components]. If you need some non-standard features, use xref:custom-components/js-component.adoc[Generic JavaScriptComponent].
* The component is relatively simple and does not load or save data itself. Otherwise, consider creating a screen fragment.

The class of a composite component must extend the `CompositeComponent` base class. A composite component must have a single component at the root of the inner components tree. The root component can be obtained using the `CompositeComponent.getComposition()` method.

Inner components are usually created declaratively in an XML descriptor. In this case, the component class should have the `@CompositeDescriptor` annotation, which specifies the path to the descriptor file. If the annotation value does not start with /, the file is loaded from the component’s class package.

[NOTE]
====
Pay attention that IDs of inner components must be unique in the screen to avoid collisions in listeners and injections. Use identifiers with some prefixes like `myCompositeComponent_currency`.
====

Alternatively, the inner components tree can be created programmatically in a `CreateEvent` listener.

`CreateEvent` is sent by the framework when it finishes the initialization of the component. At this moment, if the component uses an XML descriptor, it is loaded, and the `getComposition()` method returns the root component. This event can be used for any additional initialization of the component or creating the inner components without XML.

Below we demonstrate the creation of the `Stepper` component, which is designed to edit integer values in the input field by clicking on up/down buttons located next to the field.

[[component-layout-descriptor]]
== Creating Component Layout Descriptor

Create an XML descriptor with the component layout:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/components/stepper/stepper-component.xml[]
----

<1> XSD defines the content of the component descriptor.
<2> A single root component.
<3> Any number of nested components.
<4> Specify names of styles, which will be defined later in <<styling, Custom Styling>>. Besides custom styles defined in the project, the following predefined styles are used: xref:vcl/containers/css-layout.adoc#v-component-group[v-component-group], `icon-only`.

== Creating Component Implementation Class

Create the component implementation class in the same package:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/components/stepper/StepperField.java[]
----

<1>  The `@CompositeDescriptor` annotation specifies the path to the component layout descriptor, which is located in the class package.
<2> The component class extends `CompositeComponent` parameterized by the type of the root component.
<3> The `StepperField` component implements the `Field<Integer>` interface because it is designed to display and edit an integer value.
<4> A set of interfaces with default methods to implement standard Backoffice UI component functionality.
<5> Name of the component which is used to register this component to be recognized by the framework.
<6> Fields containing references to inner components.
<7> Component’s property, which defines the value of a single click to up/down buttons. It has a public getter/setter methods and can be assigned in screen XML.
<8> Component initialization is done in the `CreateEvent` listener.

== Creating Component Loader

Create the component loader which is needed to initialize the component when it is used in screen XML descriptors:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/components/stepper/StepperFieldLoader.java[]
----

<1> Loader class must extend `AbstractComponentLoader` parameterized by the class of the component. As our component implements `Field`, use a more specific `AbstractFieldLoader` base class.
<2> Create the component by its name.
<3> Load the `step` property value from XML if it is specified.

== Component Registration

To register the component and its loader with the framework, use the `ComponentRegistration` bean with component information:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/SampleUiApplication.java[tags=stepper-field-registration]
----

Now the framework will recognize the new component in XML descriptors of application screens.

== Creating Component XSD

XSD is required to use the component in screen XML descriptors.

Create the `app-ui-component.xsd` file in same directory as the <<component-layout-descriptor,component layout descriptor>>:

[source,xsd,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/components/stepper/app-ui-components.xsd[]
----

<1> Inherit all base field properties.
<2> Define an attribute for the `step` property.

[[styling]]
== Custom Styling

Now let’s apply some custom styles specified earlier in the xref:vcl/xml.adoc#stylename[stylename] attribute to improve the component look.

Create a xref:themes/custom_theme.adoc[custom theme] and add some CSS styles:

[source, css,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/themes/helium-ext/helium-ext.scss[tags=helium-start;stepper-field;helium-end]
----

== Using Composite Component

The following example shows how the component can be used in a screen:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/component/compositecomponent/composite-component-screen.xml[]
----

<1> The namespace referencing the component’s XSD.
<2> The composite component connected to the `rating` attribute of an entity.

Restart the application server and open the screen. The form with our composite `Stepper` component should look as follows:
