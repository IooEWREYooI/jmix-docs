= Using Existing Themes

Jmix provides built-in compiled themes: Hover, Halo, and Helium. By default, the application uses the Helium theme.

You can switch between available built-in themes in our https://demo.jmix.io/sampler/#main[Sampler^] live demo.

You can specify any built-in theme in the xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.theme.name[jmix.ui.theme.name] application property. For example, to use the *Halo* theme, you should define it in the `application.properties` file:

[source, properties]
----
jmix.ui.theme.name = halo
----
