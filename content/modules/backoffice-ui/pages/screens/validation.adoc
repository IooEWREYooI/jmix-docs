= Screen Validation

The `ScreenValidation` bean is used to run validation in screens. It has the following methods:

* `validateUiComponents()` is used by default when committing changes in the `StandardEditor`, `InputDialog`, and `MasterDetailScreen`. The method accepts a collection of components or a component container and returns validation errors in these components - `ValidationErrors` object. The `validateUiComponents()` method also can be used in an arbitrary screen. For example:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/validate/DemoScreen.java[tags=demo-screen;screen-validation;validate-ui;end]
----
+
* `showValidationErrors()` - displays a notification with all errors and problematic components. The method accepts the screen and `ValidationErrors` object. It is also used by default in the `StandardEditor`, `InputDialog`, and `MasterDetailScreen`.
* `validateCrossFieldRules()` - accepts a screen and an entity and returns the `ValidationErrors` object.  By default, it is used in the `StandardEditor`, `MasterDetailScreen`, and in the editor of the `DataGrid`. This method performs cross-field validation rules. 
+
Editor screens validate class-level constraints on the commit if the constraints include the `UiCrossFieldChecks` group and all attribute-level constraint checks are successful. You can disable this type of validation using the `setCrossFieldValidate()` method of the controller. The `validateCrossFieldRules()` method also can be used in an arbitrary screen.
+
As an example, letâ€™s look at the `Event` entity for which we can define a class-level annotation `@EventDate` to check that the start date must be lower than the end date:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/entity/Event.java[tags=validate-cross]
----
+
The annotation definition looks like this:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/validate/EventDate.java[tags=event-date-annotation]
----
+
Here is the `EventDateValidator` class:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/validate/EventDateValidator.java[tags=event-date-validator]
----
+
Then you can use the `validateCrossFieldRules()` method in an arbitrary screen.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/ui/ex1/screen/screens/validate/DemoScreen.java[tags=demo-screen;screen-validation;validate-cross;validate-date;end]
----
+
* `showUnsavedChangesDialog()` - shows the standard dialog for unsaved changes with *Yes* and *No* buttons. It is used in the `StandardEditor`. The `showUnsavedChangesDialog()` method has a handler that responds to user actions. You can see an example of usage in the `io.jmix.ui.screen.StandardEditor#preventUnsavedChanges` method.
* `showSaveConfirmationDialog()` - shows the standard dialog for confirming saving changed data with *Save*, *Do not save*, and *Cancel* buttons. It is used in the `StandardEditor`. The `showSaveConfirmationDialog()` method has a handler that responds to user actions. You can see an example of usage in the `io.jmix.ui.screen.StandardEditor#preventUnsavedChanges` method.
+
You can adjust the dialog type using xref:backoffice-ui:app-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.screen.use-save-confirmation[jmix.ui.screen.use-save-confirmation] application property.
