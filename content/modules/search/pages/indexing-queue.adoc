= Indexing Queue

As soon as you include the Search add-on in your application, it starts xref:config-options.adoc#tracking-changes[tracking changes] in your entities. In this section, we describe how to set up the automatic update of the Elasticsearch indexes with the new data.

The change tracking mechanism stores a queue of actions that should be done for changed entity instances in the the `SEARCH_INDEXING_QUEUE` database table. The `IndexingQueueManager` bean contains methods to process the queue and send changed data to Elasticsearch.

NOTE: You should set up periodic processing of the indexing queue, otherwise the search will return stale data.

You can use Quartz Job Scheduler for periodic queue processing as described below.

[[default-quartz-configuration]]
== Default Quartz Configuration

The Search add-on provides the default configuration of Quartz Job Scheduler. To process the indexing queue on a regular basis, do the following:

. Include Quartz in your project as described in the xref:ROOT:quartz-setup.adoc[] section.

. Change scheduling as CRON expression if necessary. The default value is `0/5 * * * * ?` (every 5 seconds).
+
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=cron]
----

The default configuration creates and schedules a job with the `IndexingQueueProcessing` identity.

[[custom-qurtz-configuration]]
== Custom Quartz Configuration

If you want to use a custom Quartz configuration, do the following:

. Include Quartz in your project as described in the xref:ROOT:quartz-setup.adoc[] section.

. Add the following property to the `application.properties` file to disable the default configuration:
+
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=not-default]
----
+
. Create custom job class that invokes `IndexingQueueManager.processNextBatch()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/search/ex1/service/MyCustomQueueProcessingJob.java[tags=custom-job]
----
+
. Register the following beans in the application:
+
[source,java,indent=0]

include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/search/ex1/SampleSearchApplication.java[tags=beans]

//Value of the property `jmix.search.indexingQueueProcessingCron` can be found in `io.jmix.search.SearchProperties` class.
