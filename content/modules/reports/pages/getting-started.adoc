:page-aliases: reports:quick-start.adoc

This section contains instructions about using reports wizard to create and run reports. For an easy start, the reports add-on comes with the reports wizard, which is a visual tool for quick report creation, including both xref:creation/data-structure.adoc[data structure] and xref:creation/templates.adoc[template design].

[[project_setup_report]]
== Project Setup

Installing add-ons::

First, create a new Jmix application and then follow the xref:index.adoc#installation[instruction] to install the reports add-on and charts add-on.

Creating entities and screens::

As an example, we will create a sample application https://github.com/Haulmont/jmix-docs/tree/{page-origin-branch}/content/modules/reports/examples/ex1[*Library*^] with several simple entities. You can find source code of these entities on https://github.com/Haulmont/jmix-docs/tree/{page-origin-branch}/content/modules/reports/examples/ex1/src/main/java/com/company/jmixreports/entity[Github^].

1. Create `Author` entity containing the following fields:
+
* `firstName` with `String` type.
* `lastName` with `String` type.

2. Create `LiteratureType`, `Publisher`, `LibraryDepartment`, and `Town` entities, each contains only the name field:
+
* `name` with `String` type.

3. Create `Book` entity containing the following fields:
+
* `name` with `String` type.
* `summary` with `String` type and unlimited length.
* `literatureType` associated to `LiteratureType` entity with a many-to-one relationship.
* `authors` associated to `Author` entity with a many-to-many relationship.

4. Create `BookPublication` entity containing the following fields:
+
* `year` with `Integer` type.
* `book` associated to `Book` entity with a many-to-one relationship.
* `publisher` associated to `Publisher` entity with a many-to-one relationship.
* `town` associated to `Town` entity with a many-to-one relationship.

5. Create `BookInstance` entity containing the following fields:
+
* `isReference` with `Boolean` type.
* `inventoryNumber` with `Long` type.
* `bookCount` with `Integer` type.
* `bookPublication` associated to `BookPublication` entity with a many-to-one relationship.
* `libraryDepartment` associated to `LibraryDepartment` entity with a many-to-one relationship.

6. For all the entities created above, create browser and editor screens for each of them.

Start the application then add some data for each of the entities. We will use these data for the next steps.

To run the wizard, click *Create* -> *Using wizard* in the *Reports* screen.

.Call the Report wizard
image::reports_wizard_main.png[align="center"]

Three types of reports can be created using the wizard:

. Report for a single entity.
. Report for a list of given entities.
. Report for a list of entities filtered by query.

Report design is a three steps process:

. Creating a data structure of a report.
. Editing of report regions.
. Saving the report.

The created report can be modified in the usual manner using the report editor and run through xref:run-report.adoc#run_common[the generic report browser] or using special xref:run-report.adoc#run_actions[actions] (`ListPrintFormAction`, `EditorPrintFormAction`, etc.).

[[single_entity_report]]
== Report for a Single Entity

Let us assume that we want to get information about the particular publication of a book, i.e. an instance of `BookPublication` entity.

First, run the reports wizard and specify the report details:

* *Entity* – entity to be shown in the report – `BookPublication`.
* *Template type* – report template format that defines the format of the output – xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_doc[DOCX]. Note that xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_xls[XSLX], xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_html[HTML], xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_csv[CSV] and xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_chart[Chart] formats are also available.
* *Report name* – `Publication details`.

Next, specify the report type: *Report for single entity*.

.Report for a Single Entity: step 1
image::single_entity_step_1.png[align="center"]

Then click the *Next* button; the *Select attributes for the simple report region* window appears. Specify the attributes of the `BookPublication` entity and linked entities that should be reflected in the report (`Publication.Book.Name`, `Publication.Publisher.Name`, `Publication.Year` and `Publication.Town.Name`). In order to do this, select them in the left column and move them to the right clicking image:attributes_selection_arrow.png[] or by double-click.

The order of the attributes in the report will correspond to the order specified in the right-hand side list. To change the display order, move the attributes up and down by clicking image:attributes_selection_up.png[]/image:attributes_selection_down.png[].

.Report for a Single Entity: select Entity Attributes
image::single_entity_attributes.png[align="center"]

Click *ОК* to move to the second stage – report regions editing.

The appeared screen contains a list of named regions – bands that display related data. The wizard enables adding several plain-text regions to the template in order to display different data sets.

A set of entity attributes loaded to a particular region can be modified by clicking the link represented as the list of the selected attributes. You can also add a new region by clicking *Add simple region*.

If the entity contains collection attributes, the *Add tabulated region* button will appear. It enables adding a region for tabular data display.

In both cases, the selection dialog will appear with a list of attributes of the `BookPublication` entity, allowing you to add or remove attributes from the set.

.Report for a Single Entity: step 2
image::single_entity_step_2.png[align="center"]

At this stage, we already can run the report and see how the report looks. Click the *Run* button, pick the instance of `BookPublication` and see the result.

.Test Run
image::single_entity_test_running.png[align="center"]

When all report regions are configured you can move on to the third stage: saving the report. At this point, you can view the complete report template, or change the name and format of the output file to one of the available types.

.Report output type
image::single_entity_step_3.png[align="center"]

After clicking the *Save* button, the standard report editor comes up. Now you can fine-tune the report in the usual manner. Once editing is complete, click *Save and close* in the report editor.

The report is now added to the *General* reports group in the reports browser, where you can run it from by clicking the *Run* button.

.Reports browser
image::single_entity_reports_list.png[align="center"]

Additionally, we can enable the report run on the publications browser. In order to do this, we will declare a standard xref:run-report.adoc#list_print_form_action[ListPrintFormAction] in the `book-publication-browse.xml` screen descriptor:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/screen/bookpublication/book-publication-browse.xml[tags=list-print-action]
----
<1> - the `type` attribute defines a specific `listPrintForm` action type.
<2> - add a button with run report action.

Then we should link our report with the `BookPublication` browser. Open the report editor, switch to the *Roles and Screens* tab and add the `BookPublication.browse` screen from the dropdown list to the table below:

.Add screen
image::single_entity_screens.png[align="center"]

Now you can run the report for any publication by selecting it in the table and simply clicking the *Print details* button.

.Print details
image::single_entity_running.png[align="center"]

The output is as follows:

.Report result
image::single_entity_result.png[align="center"]

[[list_of_entities_report]]
== Report for a List of Entities

The reports wizard allows you to create two types of reports for a list of entity instances:

. Report for manually selected instances of a particular entity
. Report for entity instances filtered by a certain request.

Let us have a look at the first report type. For instance, we want to obtain a list of all book instances in the library (`BookInstance` entity) with titles and library departments they belong to.

Click *Create* -> *Using wizard* in the *Reports* screen. Then, we specify the report details:

* *Entity* – report entity – `BookInstance`.
* *Template type* – output format – XSLX.
* *Report name* – report name – `Book items location`.

After that, select the type of the report (*Report for list of entities*) and click *Next*.

.Report for a List of Entities: step 1
image::list_of_entities_step_1.png[align="center"]

As per the task, we select `BookItem.Publication.Book.Name` and `BookItem.LibraryDepartment.Name` in the attributes selection window.

.Report for a List of Entities: select Entity Attributes
image::list_of_entities_attributes.png[align="center"]

Click *ОК* and move to the second stage of report regions editing.

The report template for a list of entities restricted to have only one region that displays data in tabular form. Adding new regions is not allowed, but you can edit an existing set of data by clicking on the link with the list of attributes, or remove an existing region and recreate it.

In this case, we do not need to make any changes. Click *Next* -> *Save* to save the report. The report looks as follows in the report editor:

.Report data structure
image::list_of_entities_editor.png[align="center"]

Once the report is saved, you can run it through xref:run-report.adoc#run_common[the generic report browser].

In addition, we can add a button to run the report from the book items browser, which can be opened by clicking the *Show items* button in the publications browser. In order to do this, we will set the `multiselect` attribute for the book instances table to `true` to be able to specify a set of records for the report and then declare a standard xref:run-report.adoc#list_print_form_action[ListPrintFormAction]:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/screen/bookinstance/book-instance-browse.xml[tags=list-print-action]
----
<1> - use `multiselect` mode.
<2> - the `type` attribute defines a specific `listPrintForm` action type.
<3> - add a button with run report action.

Then we should link the *Book items location* report with the book items browser. Open the report editor, switch to the *Roles and Screens* tab and add the `library$BookInstance.browse` screen from the screens dropdown to the table below:

.Add screen
image::list_of_entities_screens.png[align="center"]

Now the report can be run from the book items browser. In the *BookInstances* browser screen select items for the report in the table and click the *Print list* button. *Print selected* option exports the selected items, *Print all* option prints all instances selected by the current filter.

.Print selected
image::list_of_entities_running.png[align="center"]

The output is as follows:

.Report result
image::list_of_entities_result.png[align="center"]

[[query_report]]
== Report for a List of Entities Filtered by Query

Now let's have a look at the last report type suggested by the wizard: the report for a list of entities filtered by a query. To demonstrate this use case, we will complicate the previous example. As before, the report will contain a list of books (with their titles and department names), but only added after a certain date.

Click *Create* -> *Using wizard* in the *Reports* screen. Like in the previous case:

* *Entity* – report entity – `BookInstance`.
* *Template type* – output file format – XSLX.
* *Report name* – `Recently added book items`.

Then select the *Report for list of entities, selected by query* report type.

.Report for a List of Entities Filtered by Query: step 1
image::query_step_1.png[align="center"]

Click *Next* and move to `BookInstance` attributes selection. We move `BookItem.Publication.Book.Name` and `BookItem.LibraryDepartment.Name` attributes to the right. Click *OK* to move on to accomplish the first stage.

.Select Entity Attributes
image::list_of_entities_attributes.png[align="center"]

The report template for a list of entities restricted to have only one region that displays data in tabular form. Adding new regions is not allowed, but you can edit an existing set of data by clicking on the link with the list of attributes, or remove an existing region and recreate it.

In this case, we do not need to make any changes. Click *Next*.

.Report regions
image::query_step_2.png[align="center"]

Now *JPQL Query* window will show. In the *Query* field, it displays the auto-generated JPQL based on the entity and the attributes we selected in step 1.

To add a query condition, you can directly add it in the *Query* field or by clicking the *Create* button. For example, we added a condition `where e.createdDate >= :createDt` in the *Query* field, then click the *Generate* button to generate parameters. 

.Report query settings
image::query_step_3.png[align="center"]

Alternatively, you can click the *Create* button to add the parameter, then modify the JPQL query to use the parameter:

.Create query parameter
image::query_create_parameter.png[align="center"]

After setting JPQL query and parameters, click *Next*. Then in below *Save report* window, click *Save*.

.Save report
image::query_step_4.png[align="center"]

The editor enables making the report structure more sophisticated by adding new bands and data sets, as well as configuring the report template design, localization, access rights.

For instance, we can switch to *Parameters and Formats* tab and modify the query parameter in the *Parameters* list: `Create After` instead of the standard `CreateDt`. Save the changes and close the report editor.

.Parameters and Formats tab
image::query_parameter_rename.png[align="center"]

After all steps, let us add the *Run report* button that runs the report right from the library departments browser.

In order to do this, we need to define a new xref:run-report.adoc#run_report_action[RunReportAction] xref:backoffice-ui:actions/standard-actions.adoc[standard action] and a button for it in the `library-department-browse.xml` screen descriptor:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/jmixreports/screen/librarydepartment/library-department-browse.xml[tags=run-action]
----
<1> - the `type` attribute defines a specific `runReport` action type.
<2> - add a button with run report action.

For each report, add `LibraryDepartment.browse` to the screens list on the *Roles and Screens* tab of the report editor, as we did in the previous examples.

The *Run report* button will appear in the library departments browser, displaying the list of all reports available in the system in one click. In order to run the report, select *Recently added book items* in the list, specify the date and click *Run report*.

.Run report
image::query_running.png[align="center"]

The output is as follows:

.Report result
image::query_result.png[align="center"]

[[chart_report]]
== Report with Chart Output

Using the report wizard, you can create reports with xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_chart[chart output] in the same way as any other report types. The only difference is that you will need to configure the chart template after finishing the report in the wizard.

. Start creating a report as described in the previous chapters, but we select *Chart* as template type.
+
.Chart Template in Wizard – Step 1
image::chart_wizard.png[align="center"]

. For the chart report, select countable entity attributes – they will be later used for the value axis.
+
.Chart Template in Wizard – Select Attributes
image::chart_wizard_2.png[align="center"]

. Complete the next step of the report creation.
+
.Chart Template in Wizard – Step 2
image::chart_wizard_3.png[align="center"]

. At the last step, select the chart type – either Pie or Serial – and save the report.
+
.Chart Template in Wizard – Step 3
image::chart_wizard_4.png[align="center"]

. Finally, configure the chart axis on the *Templates* tab of the report editor.
+
.Chart Template Configuration
image::chart_wizard_5.png[align="center"]

Then, you can run the report in xref:run-report.adoc#run_common[the generic report browser]. For more information about chart templates, please refer to xref:creation/templates.adoc#template_chart[template documentation].
