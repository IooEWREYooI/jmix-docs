= Data Components

Data components are non-visual elements of views that provide loading of data, binding it to data-aware visual components and saving changed data back to the data store.

Flow UI data components are identical to those of xref:ui:data-components.adoc[classic UI], with the following differences in `DataContext`:

* The method of saving changes is called `save()` instead of `commit()`.
* Events sent before and after saving are called `PreSaveEvent` and `PostSaveEvent`.
