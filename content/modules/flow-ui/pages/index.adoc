= Flow UI (Incubating)

Flow UI is a new user interface subsystem built on top of the latest https://vaadin.com/flow[Vaadin Flow] framework. It is a modern alternative to the xref:ui:index.adoc[classic UI].

NOTE: Flow UI is now in the incubating state, meaning that it is actively developed but not yet comparable in features with the classic UI.

You can create a project with the Flow UI by selecting the `Full-Stack Application with Incubating FlowUI` template in the new project wizard.
