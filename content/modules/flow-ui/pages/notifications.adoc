= Notifications

Notifications are pop-up messages displayed to inform users about activities, processes, and events in the application.

To show a notification, inject the `Notifications` bean into the view class and use its fluent interface. In the following example, a notification with default parameters is shown on the button click:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/dialogsandnotifications/notifications/NotificationSampleView.java[tag=notification-1]
----

Below is an example of a parameterized notification:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/dialogsandnotifications/notifications/NotificationSampleView.java[tag=notification-2]
----
