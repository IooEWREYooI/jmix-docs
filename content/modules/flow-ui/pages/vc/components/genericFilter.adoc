= genericFilter

`genericFilter` component is a versatile tool for filtering the data it is bound to.

The component enables <<quick-filtering,quick data filtering>> with arbitrary conditions, as well as creating configurations for repeated use.

* XML element: `genericFilter`

* Java class: `GenericFilter`

== Basics

`genericFilter` should be connected to a data loader of a standalone `CollectionContainer` or `keyValueCollectionContainer`. It generates a `Condition` object that is set to the loader and later processed by the xref:data-model:data-stores.adoc[data store]. For a xref:data-model:entities.adoc#jpa[JPA entity], the data store translates the resulting JPQL query, so that filtering is done on the database level, and then only the result is loaded from the database to the application memory.

The `genericFilter` component is added by default to a xref:flow-ui:views.adoc#standard-list-view[list view] of an entity.

An example of `filter` declaration in the XML screen descriptor is given below:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/genericfilter/generic-filter-view.xml[tags=data;customerDc;layout;generic-filter;customersTable]
----

In the example above, the data container holds the collection of `Customer` entity instances. The data loader loads the collection using a JPQL query. The `genericFilter` component is connected to the loader using the `dataLoader` attribute. Data is displayed using the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc[`dataGrid`] component, which is connected to the data container.

A typical filter is shown below:

. [[refresh-button]] The *Refresh* button with the drop-down menu.
. [[operator-selector]] The comparison operator selector.
. [[filter-settings-button]] The *Filter Settings* button.
. [[refresh-drop-down-menu]] The list of saved filters and configurations.
. [[condition-fields]] The condition value field.
. [[add-condition-link]] The *Add search condition* link.

[[quick-filtering]]
By default, the component is in quick filter mode. It means that a user can add a set of conditions for a one-off data search. After the screen is closed, the conditions will disappear.

== Quick Filter Example

Letâ€™s assume that we have the `Customer` entity and want to:

* Create a quick filter with multiple conditions in the *Customer browser* screen.
* Save this filter for future use.

=== Creating a Quick Filter

* Click <<add-condition-link,*Add search condition*>>.
* Select the properties to filter by. For example: *Age* and *Hobby*.
+
Selected properties will appear in the condition panel above the filter.
* Select an operator and enter a value for each property.

=== Saving the Filter

* Click the <<filter-settings-button,*Filter Settings*>> button, and then select *Save with values*.
* Enter a name for the filter configuration and click *OK* to save it:

This configuration can now be selected from the <<refresh-button,*Refresh*>> button's drop-down menu.

Select the *<Reset filter>* menu option on top to reset all currently applied search conditions.
