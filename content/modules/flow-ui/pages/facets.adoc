= Facets

Facets are non-visual components that add supplementary behavior to the view or its components.

[[built-in]]
== Built-in Facets

The framework provides the following facets:

* xref:facets/dataLoadCoordinator.adoc[]
* xref:facets/urlQueryParameters.adoc[]

[[custom]]
== Custom Facets

The application or an add-on can provide its own facets. To create a custom facet, follow the steps below:

1. Create an interface extending `io.jmix.flowui.facet.Facet`.
2. Create an implementation class based on `io.jmix.flowui.facet.impl.AbstractFacet`.
3. Create a Spring bean implementing the `io.jmix.flowui.xml.facet.FacetProvider` interface parameterized by the type of your facet.
4. Create an XSD to be used in view XML.
5. Optionally, create an annotated interface to add support for the facet in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel of the Studio view designer.

The `DataLoadCoordinator` and `UrlQueryParametersFacet` classes of the framework can be good examples of creating a facet.
