= List Component Actions

List component actions work with collections of entities that are displayed in xref:vc/components/dataGrid.adoc[] or xref:vc/components/treeDataGrid.adoc[].

When a list action is added to a `dataGrid` or `treeDataGrid`, it can be invoked from the componentâ€™s context menu. Usually, actions are also invoked by associated buttons.

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/actions/standard-list-actions-view.xml[tags=list-actions-1]
----

Below are the standard list action types.

[[add]]
== add

Action class: `AddAction`

Adds existing entity instances to a data container by looking them up in a list view. Can be used to fill a many-to-many collection.

[[create]]
== create

Action class: `CreateAction`

Creates a new entity instance in the entity detail view.

[[edit]]
== edit

Action class: `EditAction`

Edits the selected entity instance in the entity detail view.

[[exclude]]
== exclude

Action class: `ExcludeAction`

Removes entity instances from a data container. Unlike <<remove,remove>> action, `exclude` does not remove the selected instance from the database. It is required, for example, when working with a many-to-many collection.

[[read]]
== read

Action class: `ReadAction`

Opens the entity detail view in the same way as <<edit,edit>> action, but makes all fields non-editable and disables save actions.  If you want to allow users to switch the view to the editable mode, add the xref:actions/view-actions.adoc#detail_enableEditing[detail_enableEditing] action to the view.

[[refresh]]
== refresh

Action class: `RefreshAction`

Reloads the data container used by the `dataGrid` component.

[[remove]]
== remove

Action class: `RemoveAction`

Removes entity instances from the data container in UI and from the database.
